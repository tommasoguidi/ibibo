Atmosferico II LyricsUntil the night is over
Turn on the amp

Darkness is my shelter
Concealed by beams of light

This is where we gather
To feed our wishing souls

Smoke and sweat in beads
Redemption is our goal
Glamorous vapors fill the atmosphere
Heads rage like waves in a storming seaYou might also likeEmbed
