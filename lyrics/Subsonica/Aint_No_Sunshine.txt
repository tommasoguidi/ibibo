Ainâ€™t No Sunshine LyricsAin't no sunshine when she she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know

I know
I know
I know
I know

I know
I know
I know
I know

I know
I know
I know
I know
I know

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away...
