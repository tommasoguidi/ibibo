Angeles LyricsSomeone's always coming around here trailin' some new kill
Says I seen a picture on a hundred dollar bill
What's a game of chance to you
Him is one
Of real skill
So glad to meet you Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go on lose the gamble that's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play
To zero
Sign up with evil Angeles
Don't start me tryin' now!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh...
Cus I'm all over it, Angeles
I can make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
Be forever with my poison arms
Around you
No one's gonna fool a-round with us
No one's gonna fool a-round with us
So glad to meet you AngelesYou might also likeEmbed
