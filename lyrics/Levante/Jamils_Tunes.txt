[Verse 1]
Man Fuck this life
No forget my vice
Im stuck in a corner
With my heart in my soul
Soakin man is this right
Lost in the vibes of lonely song
While im paused in a time with of a life
Unknown while im lookin'
At the ceiling were my world is shown
So what do i see
A kid steppin out on this empty road
Black in hand shit ain't enough
Gotta blunt instead
He just seekin'
Looking for passion detication
He maskin full of potiental
But times a bastard
So he lays in the grass
Moon is so full
But he notice a pain so he crashes deep
Yeh
But he fall so deep
Fallen' my nigga jamil
Is fallen so hard
But he not even asleep
He got up
Got up and heard a voice
Then got up immediatly
He ran for the heavens
But hell at a continues creep
So he gets to his house
Runs to his room
Looks in mirror
An angel and demon is all
He see's screams
Pushes the mirror
Then he starts to bleed
Hops in the bed to hopefully
To be left be then start
To sink god giving the
Realization of what could be
Get yo shit together or he gone
Leave your ass immediatly
[Devil Voice Talking to Jamil]
Hehehe
Jamil you have no life
And you always depressed at night
You love yo girl but she
Treat you like shit inspite
Fuck that shit
Fuck god
This shit isnt complex
You on the brink of no return
And were the fuck is he at
Grab that knife on the floor an
Do what you need too
I got you im all for you
You been willing to sell your soul
So if u do you can finally
Sign that contract if its possible
Jamil you gone be better
When you do this because I got
You

[Verse 2]
So jamil keep thinkin' huh
He critically keep thinkin'
See If I die ill be chill no I want
Yes I will but everybody still
Blowin up still this is dark times
But it can be light at the end the tunnel
But maybe this light is truely darkness
Right cause I dont know man
Im wonder if choosing the good
Gone haunt you or haunt me
Is choosing the good the good way
Or is it really my perspective anyway
Right now to this day
Been writing in my notebook just to take
All this pain away just to take all this away
I just need to do it
I just need to do it ima end this shit
Like biggie said in suicidal thoughts
And have my whole blood spewin'
The pressure
Of choosing got me
Messed up in the head I think
Ima loose it ima put the knife down
An cry myself to sleep
Woke up the next morning
Reading the bible giving myself to god
Is the only think that I can see
I gave myself to god but
Lucy still talking to me in my sleep
Lucy still talking to me in my sleep
God
God I know you hear me help me
Please
