Philadelphia Lyrics[Testo di "Philadelphia"]

[Ritornello]
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right

[Strofa 1]
I've got my friends in the world
I had my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled
[Strofa  2]
City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love

[Ritornello]
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all rightYou might also likeEmbed
