[Testo di "Expecting to Fly"]

[Strofa 1]
There you stood, on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowing that you'd gone

[Ritornello]
By the summer it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
[Strofa 2]
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found
Knowing it was gone

[Ritornello 2]
If I never lived without you
Now you know I'd die
If I never said I loved you
Now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I’d try
