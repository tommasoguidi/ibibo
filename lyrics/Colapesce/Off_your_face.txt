Off your face LyricsHate
Pretend that I
Adore you

Hate
What do you take me
For you

Crybaby, shame
You're in love with the game
Swallow the pain
Nothing else will remain
Hate
What I will do is
Scar you

Hate
Don't say I didn't
Warn you

Crybaby, shame
You're in love with the game
Riding away
And then carefree againYou might also likeEmbed
