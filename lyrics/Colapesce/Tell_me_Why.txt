Tell me Why Lyrics[Testo di "Tell me Why"]

[Strofa 1]
Sailin' hardships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Pre-Ritornello]
Tell me why
Tell me why
[Ritornello]
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

[Strofa 2]
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

[Pre-Ritornello]
Tell me why
Tell me why

[Ritornello]
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Pre-Ritornello]
Tell me why
Tell me why

[Ritornello]
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?You might also likeEmbed
