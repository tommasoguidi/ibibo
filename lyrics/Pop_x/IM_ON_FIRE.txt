[Strofa 1]
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire

[Ritornello]
'Cause I'm on fire

[Strofa 2]
Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
[Ritornello]
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

[Strofa 3]
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull
At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

[Ritornello]
Because you
And I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on firе
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
