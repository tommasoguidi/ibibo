Django Lyrics[Testo di "Django"]

[Intro]
Buonasera, signori e signore
Benvenuti in questa bellissima plaza
Nel giro di pochi secondi
Apprenderete delle gesta di un uomo marcio
Senza alcun ritegno
Questo povero diavolo mica lo conoscete
Scappato dal nostro paesino da tempo immemore
Ma ancora le strade cercano il suo passo
Le piazze chiedono dei suoi occhi
Giuro su Dio che il vento ogni tanto
Sussurra il suo nome
[Assolo di fisarmonica]

[Strofa 1]
I like when the eyes of the stars meet mine
I like my caravan, I like beer, I like wine
There's only one thing I don't like at all
It's when the guitar do not play rock 'n' roll

[Ritornello]
Gipsy the moon and gipsy the sun
They always move and if they don't we get fucked
Gipsy those years now that they've gone
When the show must go off
We'll come out from our hideouts and dance

[Bridge]
We gonna dance
We gonna dance and shine
We gonna dance
We gonna dance and shine

[Strofa 2]
Jasmine when you're gone I cried so much, that's true
Don't you know that you were my life, that you were my soul, that you were my you
But then I realized when the car didn't start
That you stole the engine and so I shouted: "What a fucking slut!" (What a fucking slut!)
Gipsy love stories never last 'cause you know
The more we are bastard the more we enjoy the show
But Jasmine I forgave you, so come back to me
I'll give you my song and I shiny new kind of fucking machine
You might also like[Ritornello]
Gipsy the moon and gipsy the sun
They always move and if they don't we get fucked
Gipsy those years now that they've gone
When the show must go off
We'll come out from our hideouts and dance
Gipsy the moon and gipsy the sun
They always move and if they don't we get fucked
Gipsy those years now that they've gone
When the show must go off
We'll come out from our hideouts and dance

[Outro]
And dance
And dance
And dance
