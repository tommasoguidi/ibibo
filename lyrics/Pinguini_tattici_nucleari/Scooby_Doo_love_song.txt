Scooby Doo love song Lyrics[Testo di "Scooby Doo love song"]

[Intro]
Aaaaah!

[Verse 1]
Yes, baby I am a Great Dane
Don't you wanna offa me your kennel yeah?
Baby I am so big and when I move
The Earth quakes under my paws
Baby don't you be afraid you're the only one
Who keeps me on a leash
I don't know why you refuse me baby
I love you more than the first time!
[Chorus 1]
Cause I am Scooby-Doo and I am loving you
And if you wanna scare me I will hold on
Yes I am Scooby-Doo and I am loving you
And if you hate me I will take my own way and say: "Goodbye!"
Ratatata
Goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby now don't you tell me you love Shaggy
You know he's my best friend right?
And maybe one day all this stuff will get better
If you don't bother
Baby you're my mystery, my monster
And my angel at the same time
I can't let you with Shaggy
I know he plays with your heart!

[Chorus 2]
Cause I am Scooby-Doo discovering the truth
And if you wanna scare me I will hold on
Yes I am Scooby-Doo and I am loving you
And if you hate me I will take my own way
And say: "Goodbye!"

[Post-Chorus]
Scooby-Doo Scooby-Doo
Me and you Scooby-Doo
Scooby-Doo Scooby-Doo
Me and you Scooby-Doo
