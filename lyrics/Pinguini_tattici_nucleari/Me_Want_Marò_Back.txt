Me Want Marò Back Lyrics[Testo di "Me Want Marò Back"]

[Strofa 1]
Ciao to everybody, I'm the player of the bongo
My voice's the usual voice of the player of the bongo (Eh, eh)
Hearing my voice you may think I'm fat as a dugongo
Now you've just offended the player of the bongo
In fact the real problem is me metabolism
Let's not talk about myself, can you feel the rhythm?
This right wing castaman has no song about love
'Cause all I want is marò, yeah, all I want is marò
Me were walking down the street on a
Cris sunny day
When I hear the bad news
Marò were put in a jail (Woh-oh-oh)
Indian government you bomboclat
You crucified marò
I tell ya, they did nothing wrong
Except killing innocent pescatori
[Ritornello]
Me want marò back
Me want what is right (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
And many enemies, much pride (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
Yeah, me want 'em safe at home (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
And bulldozer on campo rom

[Bridge]
Aah
Yeye wata
Yeye wata
Pinguini Tattici Nucleari
Motherfucker

[Strofa 2]
Left people say I'm mad 'cause I
Strumentalise marò
I tell them: "Eat less kebab
And go back to your fucking stupid reeking centro sociale di merda stronzi"
Indian government, you bomboclat
Yes, I am talking to you, adoratori di mucche
I tell ya, we will give you Nichi Vendola
If you give us back marò
Three, two, one
You might also like[Ritornello]
Me want marò back
Me want what is right (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
And many enemies, much pride (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
Me want 'em safe at home (Me wanna, me wanna)
Me want marò back
And bulldozer on campo rom

[Bridge]
Are you with me, people? Yeah
This is reggae music
So I want you to raise your hands to the sky
And sing with me the song of marò

[Ritornello]
Me want marò back
(Ho sentito parlare dei diritti delle donne in Pakistan: giusto)
Me want marò back
(Dei cristiani perseguitati in Nigeria: giusto)
Me want marò back
(Perché ci sono due soldati non italiani, ma europei, da due anni in galera in India
Non una parola sui marò, non una parola)

[Ritornello]
Me want marò back
Because when he was here, the trains were on time
Me want marò back
Bonifications of the Agro Pontino (Pompino, pompino)
Me want marò back
No adoptions to people of strange sexualities
Me want marò back
And what about the foibes? Mmm what about the foibes?
Me want marò back
My cousin works, my cousin works for the polizia postale
Me want marò back
[Outro]
Listen, go build your moschea elsewhere
We don't want you here in Bassano Del Grappa
You rape our women, steal our grappa
È stato divertente giocare in allegria ma ora anche bastaEmbed
