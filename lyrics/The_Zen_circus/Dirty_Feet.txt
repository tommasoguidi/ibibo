Dirty Feet LyricsHeretical poetry and italian wine
Please take me away from the modern times
Freedom means nothing when you're out of luck
But nothing is freedom if you loose attack

I have dirty feet, I have dirty feet
And got nowhere to go
I have dirty feet laying on the street
And a smile on my face

I got a million people inside my head
A thousand are dead and the rest feel bad
But nothing can hurt me, I'm not working today
Freedom means nothing on such a sunny day
I have dirty feet, I have dirty feet
And got nowhere to go
I have dirty feet laying on the street
And a smile on my faceYou might also likeEmbed
