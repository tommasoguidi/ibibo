[Testo di "Oh, the River!"]

Oh me! Oh me! I just can't see
The beauty of the sea
Is too big
But the river on the river
Probably i'm at fault
But is not a joke
The sky got really nothing wrong
Yes i know
But the river on the river
Flows by flows by
Just like my life until the last breath
Flows by flows
And seems to make things work togheter
Flows by flows
The river in one direction
Flows by flows
The river the river
My river can stand it all
No matter what
As long as i wonder but
It's all wrong
But the river on the river
Dum dum dum dum
It's all gone
But the river on the river
Flows by flows by
Just like my life until the last breath
Flows by flows
And seems to make things work togheter
Flows by flows
The river in one direction
Flows by flows
The river the river
