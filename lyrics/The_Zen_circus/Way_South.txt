[Verse 1]
Well it's a long way to the South
It took a month to get just where we’re now
And half money had been spent I know
But I wanted, you wanted to go
The sun is hot so much it almost burns
We just don't mind because we already know
We’ll spend a whole year into blue waters
So I wanted, you wanted to go
And isn't it fun we break and leave us by feet
I hope is just another [my black finances]
That a thousand miles is not that huge far, man
'Cause I wanted, we all wanted to go
And isn't it fun that we were about to stop
Life ain't no holiday but at least you hang on
And there's no better prize than having such fun, man
I wanted, you wanted to go
[Pre Chorus]
So let’s go!

[Chorus]
Pack your bag, we don't mind about the weather
Is not a problem, no is not a problem
And we won't care if you are not that clever
Is not a problem, no is not a problem
And there’s no time to be
That slowly, that lousy, that constantly deep thinking

[Verse 2]
Yes, is a long way to the South
A hundred languages passed by
And we're traveling in the italian way
Like we are at home everyday
Here comes the sun right behind a hill
Like a desire that has been fulfilled
And no better thing should have ever been done, man
'Cause I wanted, you wanted to go

[Pre Chorus]
So let’s go!

[Chorus]
Pack your bag, we don't mind about the weather
Is not a problem, no is not a problem
And we won't care if you are not that clever
Is not a problem, no is not a problem
And there’s no time to be
That slowly, that lousy, that constantly deep thinking
