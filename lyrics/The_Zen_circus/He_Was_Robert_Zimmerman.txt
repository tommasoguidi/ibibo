He Was Robert Zimmerman Lyrics[Testo di "He Was Robert Zimmerman"]

[Strofa 1]
There is a tale I often tell
About a boy who changed the world
With his own hands
Then became old and lost his grace
And every moment drew a line
On his face
And is no holiday
[Ritornello]
Mr. Bob Dylan
He was Robert Zimmerman
Just a boy discovering life
Mr. Bob Dylan
He was Robert Zimmerman
Just a boy

[Strofa 2]
Youth is richness
Youth is art
You can fail a million times
But you're gonna rise up
Right now I'm a young man
And my blood is compromised
Not cigarettes or drinks
Death comes cause of life and it's no holiday

[Instrumental]

[Ritornello]
Mr. Bob Dylan
He was Robert Zimmerman
Just a boy discovering life
Mr. Bob Dylan
He was Robert Zimmerman
Just a boy
Discovering life
Just a boy
