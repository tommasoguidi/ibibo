[Testo di "Jack (Is American)"]

Like when I’m bathing in the sun
Every girl is the girl who’ll break my heart, but do they
Do they, do they have some
Fascination or some charme
Some sex appeal like a french one yeah

Jack is american, he likes americans Jack lives in america, merry him, merry us

The very best that you could ever get
Is to have every girl at your own cammand, just like
“Sweety what do you want?”
“Mr Charlie needs some love!”
“Am I your only onе?”
“Thats what you’re not baby!”
Jack is american, he likеs americans
Jack lives in america, merry him, merry us

Jack is american, he likes americans

The very best you could ever get
Is to have every girl at your own command, just like
“Sweety what do you want now?”
“Mr Charlie needs a blow job!”
“Am I your only one?”
“Thats what you’re not baby!”

Jack is american, he likes americans

Jack lives in america, merry him, merry us
