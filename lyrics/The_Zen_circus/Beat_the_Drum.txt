Beat the Drum Lyrics[Testo di "Beat the Drum"]

You gotta beat the drum kid and gotta beat it louder
Doesn't matter what they say doesn't matter no complaint
You gotta beat it harder 'till the rythm is done
You gotta hold your breath kid and gotta hold it longer
When times get rough and no one's there
You'll be the one to take good care
You gotta hold your breath kid
May not have a sense kid do you hear me
We're gonna write togheter our own constitution
We're gonna live togheter without an institution
The rise and fall of failure land it's up to you to make it stand
You're gonna build it up boy you're gonna wreck it down man
We're the bellybutton for the new intentions
Gotta beat the drum for the twist generation
The rise and fall of failure land it's up to you to make it stand
You're gonna build it up boy gotta wreck it down man
Oh lalalalala stand up stand up oh lalalalaYou might also likeEmbed
