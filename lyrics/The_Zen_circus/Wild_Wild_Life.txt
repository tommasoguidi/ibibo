[Testo di "Wild Wild Life"]

I'm wearin' fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
It's ticklin' my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you

Here on this mountaintop
Oh oh oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell you
Oh oh
About some wild, wild life
Here comes the doctor in charge
Oh oh oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it?
Oh oh
Living wild, wild life

I wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sittin' on a window sill, but he
Spends his time behind closed doors

Check out the businessman
Oh oh oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange
Oh oh oh
He got some wild, wild life

Break it up when he opens the door
Oh oh oh
He doin' wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it
Oh oh
Living wild, wild

Peace of mind?
It's a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board anytime you like

Like sittin' on pins and needles
Things fall apart, it's scientific

Sleepin' on the interstate
Oh oh oh
Gettin' wild, wild life
Checkin' in, a checkin' out
Oh oh oh
I got a wild, wild life

Spendin' all of my money and time
Oh oh oh
Done too much wild, wild
We wanna go, where we go, where we go
Oh oh oh
I doin' wild, wild life

I know it, that's how we start
Oh oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture, here in the daylight
Oh, oh
And it's some wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast
Oh oh oh
Wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it
Oh, oh
Living wild wild wild wild life
