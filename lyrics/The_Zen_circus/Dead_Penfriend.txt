[Testo di "Dead Penfriend"]

Drop me a line from heaven
Dead penfriend
There i heard it's only peace and love
Peace and love and not a word
I wonder what’s wrong with heaven
Please tell us
I just know the problems down here
Good times have gone that is all i can tell
Dear dead penfriend
I know a girl from heaven
Called mary
She's the kind i like and that's no good you sinner!
Because she can see me
Uh oh oh oh
When i hang around with devil’s son down here
Good times have gone that is all i can tell
Dear dead penfriend uh
Antonio since i got a dead penfriend
