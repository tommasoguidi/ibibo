TranslationsItalianoBlack Hole LyricsIf your heart is not mine and your body is not mine
What the hell I got of you to keep it in my mind
My dear I'm so sad about the boy I am
I used to be happy and I used to be frank
Your body is too near, too near to be touched
I was kinda easy, but tonight I got back
Tonight I got back, tonight I got back
Tonight I got back, into my black hole

So tell me what's wrong about being alone
When there's a whole universe spinnin' around my nose
They say life is too short, but to me is too long
One more night in your garden then I'm ready to go
My dear I'm so glad that you were not there
I was kinda easy but tonight I got back
Tonight i got back, tonight I got back
Tonight i got back into my black holeYou might also likeEmbed
