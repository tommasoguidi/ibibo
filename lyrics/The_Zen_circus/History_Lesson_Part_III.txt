TranslationsItalianoHistory Lesson Part III LyricsEvery night back in my place
Drunk or sober, tired or not
I wonder where the girl I'll meet sleeps
I dream the million ways she could look
Every day while I'm on my way
When life is a disaster or even when I'm high
I wonder what the people 'round the world do
I wonder what the circumstacies force them to

So many times I said to myself
This place looks familiar when it was not
People could say is just a trick of mind
But have they ever been on a hill at night
Went outta my home
Get lost in the snow
Please don't think I didn't knew the road
Wondering what the people 'round the world do
Wondering what the circumstacies force them toYou might also likeEmbed
