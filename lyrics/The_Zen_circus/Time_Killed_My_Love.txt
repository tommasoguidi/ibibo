Time Killed My Love LyricsThe beach on rainy day
My cigarettes are gone but I won't complaint
There is ash on my skirt, there's mud on my shoes
I'm wet as a kite and it's cold as ice
It's 7 am, sun stands quite high
My car next to me but it seems that
That i slept on the ground just under the rain
The bottle is over and and a headace is near

I wonder why I'm still living this shit
It's already a decade that I wake up like this
But then I think to me
We all were kids nothing plainer than that
And used to treat time as a matter of fact
It was cool to be dumb and dumb to be cool
And I wrote a million pages in a year or two
But look at us now, we got no more love
We all have been stucked, we all are sad
A whole life in a year or in a day when you die
It's just time, a damned matter of time

I wonder why I never grew up
And or if I did I still have to check out
But then I think to me

Maybe I was scared, just underprepared
And now I pay price that I already paid
My time has come to become a manYou might also likeEmbed
