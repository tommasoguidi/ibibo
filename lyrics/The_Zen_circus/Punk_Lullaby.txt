Punk Lullaby Lyrics[Testo di "Punk Lullaby" ft. Brian Ritchie]

[Intro]
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, sweet baby
Punk lullaby
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, sweet baby, sweet
Punk lullaby

[Strofa 1]
He's milky tall and skinny
Got hands petite and clean
He's a kind of girl
He looks so much younger
A sort of Dorian Gray
He's a kind of girl
[Pre-Ritornello 1]
Just a kind of girl
When he's looking at his feet
In a kind of punk lullaby
Just a kind of girl
But he's a man enough to her

[Ritornello]
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, sweet baby
Punk lullaby
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, sweet baby, sweet
Punk lullaby

[Strofa 2]
She's rude and neurotic
She got a fucked up car
She's a kind of boy
The way she talk is dirty
And digs politics and rock
She's a kind of boy

[Pre-Ritornello 2]
She's a kind of boy
When she's driving in her car
In a kind of punk lullaby
She's a kind of boy
But she's a girl enough to him
