[Verse 1]
Mom got fucked
Dad got too
For all I love
I can't speak you
I had my time
To decide who I am
This long meditation
Got me going like this

[Chorus]
It turns me on, turns me on
Is the power of my people that turns me on
It turns me on, turns me on
Is the power of my people that turns me on
[Verse 2]
You’ll hide from us
Like we do now
You’ll point your finger
To the next roundabout
Final cut, sir
It’s almost done
So tell me how does it feel
Feeling stupid like this

[Chorus]
It turns me on, turns me on
Is the power of my people that turns me on
It turns me on, turns me on
Is the power of my people that turns me on
