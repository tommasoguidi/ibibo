Summer (of Love) LyricsThink of me this summer
While you fuck with him
He is a strong and straight guy
Not a jerk like me

But please dont mess that lovely dress
You loved me once you must confess

Think of me this summer
While you blow his will
Probably is bigger
Please dear think of me
But please dont mess that lovely dress
You loved me once you must confessYou might also likeEmbed
