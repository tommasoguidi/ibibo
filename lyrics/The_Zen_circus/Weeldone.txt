Weeldone LyricsUseless can't be wrong about breakin' my ass
Just another day then bye bye
Tthere's nothin' else we could save
At least this mess is done
Is done, alright, welldone

Is helpless to read if you don't understand
A single word in a book
A single word from your friends
I know it's a decadent opinion
But it comes from my condition
Don't you think it was nice in 1978
Is done, welldone
And I guess that somebody's cry
Has been heard by god and then he closed his eyes
Shut is mouth, put his hands on his hears
Then felt ashamed for what he did

Pinhead you give me reason to live
I don't really wanna die
And I think I can fly
But this mess at least is done

And I guess that somebody's cry
Has been heard by god and then he closed his eyes
Shut is mouth, put his hands on his hears
Then felt ashamed for what he didYou might also likeEmbed
