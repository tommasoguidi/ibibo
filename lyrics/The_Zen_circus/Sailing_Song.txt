Sailing Song Lyrics"Hip", said the boy
"Oh!", said the girl
That is all, one more point
Neither like me nor like my head
Understand, one more point
The cook stays high, the beach is low
Ah ah ah ah, one more point

And Jeffrey got stucked with the French champagne
He said "This is life", one more point
Brother Paul you know you're old
You're not twelve anymore
Ah ah ah ah, one more point
One sailing song for everyone
'Cause that one just wants one to get on

Lovely head is a girl without hair
She's so cool one more point
But she doesn't want me into her bed
Mercy me, one more point

Many things should come and go
But drugs are here to stay
Ah ah ah ah, one more point

One sailing song for everyone
'Cause that one just wants one to get onYou might also likeEmbed
