Everybody wants to see
Mafia, pizza e mandoli'

How it's beautiful Turin
Here is the mole, here was the king
Pannacotta with grissini, agnolotti del Plin
(Pija 'na cadrega)
Thanks Maneskin, Eurovision in Turin
Everybody wants to see
Bagnacauda e bicerin
Juventus, Torino, the Alps, the vino
The Sindone, the smog

I know Rome is bigger, there is water in Venice
Milano is richer, but Torino is crazy
(Boia Fauss)
