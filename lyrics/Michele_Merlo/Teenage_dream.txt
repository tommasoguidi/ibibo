Teenage dream LyricsWhite tees, laugh and tears
Black clothes, is getting cold here
So we fall and we play for the night calling
We rip our jeans to feel some glory
We had fun to sleep but didn't have dreams
Cause we don't dream things we don't believe in

We smoke to forget, we smoke to regret
We smoke so we can see what normally we can't

Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream
Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream
Let's get high in then some more
Then we'll take it down to the floor
Your body next to mine
Wet hair girl, you're looking fine

We turn around, we look at them
The fears of demons in our head
I wear your clothes when we're both high
Chasing stars into the sky

Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream
Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream

Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream
Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream

Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dream
Life in a drink, life in a dream
Ink on my skin, my teenage dreamYou might also likeEmbed
