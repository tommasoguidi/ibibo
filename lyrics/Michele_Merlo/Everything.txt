[verse 1]
One day to get her
Her name on my skin
One way to get her
Just nothing but dreams
And sorry if i crushed
I was driving too fast
For the pain, can i say? babe

[Chorus]
'cause i feel so good when i'm without you
And i feel sad too when i'm without you
And girl, do you miss me too when i'm without you
((i'm sorry, i fucked up, everything))
[drop]

[verse 2]
I'm begging you to see
There's a better side of me
And how you're gonna feel home
If you wanna be alone
I made a plan, don't you see?
Gotta catch it right up
Close to me
Gotta close my eyes
But i wanna see
Where you're not here baby
Next to me

[Chorus]
'cause i feel so good when i'm without you
And i feel sad too when i'm without you
And girl, do you miss me too when i'm without you

[drop]
Oh oh oh oh [x2]

[outro]
When i'm without
Everything everything (oh oh oh oh)
Everything everything (oh oh oh oh)
Everything everything (oh oh oh oh)
