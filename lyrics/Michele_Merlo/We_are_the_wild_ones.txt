[Verse 1]
My nights are long
We only know how to waste our life
But when you're young
You need someone just for a high
Just for a high

[Chorus]
'Cause we are the wild ones
But we are not strong at all
'Cause we are the wild ones
But we know [?] we're all
We are not strong at all
[Verse 2]
In our life, we took our time
You know what we could be
And where we fall from now on
We feel alive, we feel alive, we feel alive

[Chorus]
'Cause we are the wild ones
But we are not strong at all
'Cause we are the wild ones
But we are not strong at all
But we know [?] know
We can swim but not run

'Cause we are the wild ones
But we are not strong at all
'Cause we are the wild ones
But we are not strong at all
But we know [?] know
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
We can swim but not run
