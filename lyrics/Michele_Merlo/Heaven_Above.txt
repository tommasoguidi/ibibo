Heaven Above LyricsIf you fall i pick u up
Or i lay down next to you
Cause without you i feel lost
And i don't know how bout you

Can i hide in you car?
You whispered in my ear
I said why? You said
Cause i feel happy with you here

Heaven above
Is all that i see now, heaven above
Is all that i see now, all that i see
I just feel insane
I dont need anything babe
Ill find out another lane
And ill have some new to say
I feel bad cause iâ€™ve got nothing at all
I miss all the things all the hate all the love
You in my sweather and the sky above

Can i hide in you car?
You whispered in my ear
I said why? You said
Cause i feel happy with you here

Heaven above
Is all that i see now, heaven above
Is all that i see now, all that i seeYou might also likeEmbed
