Desire LyricsWatching the signs and now I’m going along
‘nother goodbye but no real reason to go
Waiting around I see you turning to stone
You know your ground and do whatever you want
I let you decide but now our bodies are sore

Don’t let me down
Don’t let me leave oh no no

Oh oh oh
We’re on cloud nine
We feel alive
You got it
Oh oh oh
I know that you are mine
We’ll go far baby

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Baby don’t hide because these feelings are gold
The lights are flashing while we’re hitting the wall
Deep hunting scars where there were flowers before
We’re on the ground but just hold on
Feel safe and sound and let me into your door

Don’t let me down
Now let the people, people know

Oh oh oh
We’re on cloud nine
We feel alive
You got it

Oh oh oh
You’re my desire
We’ll go far baby

Oh oh oh
You’re gettin high
You’re flying blind
You know it
You might also likeOh oh oh
I know that you’re mine
Love is crazy

We’re runnin’ wild because we’re living out loud
We need to show them what you and me is about, somehow
We feel alive
You’re my desire

Oh oh oh
We’re on cloud nine
We feel alive
You got it

Oh oh oh
You’re my desire
We’ll go far baby

Oh oh oh
We’re on cloud nine
We feel alive
You got it

Oh oh oh
You’re my desire
We’ll go far baby
Oh oh oh
You are getting high
You are flying blind
You know it

Oh oh oh
I know that you’re mine
Love is crazyEmbed
