Closer LyricsDoes this feeling flow both ways?
When you take my breath away
Is there a cure for this pain
We now call love again?

And I'm letting my hair grow
So I'm not gonna feel old
There's a pain going around
Like a wolf seaking for new blood

I got your name tattooed on me
And you have tons of them
But when I look at you on my bed
I see my name is not there
I draw tears on my face to remind
Myself I gotta cry one day, cry one day
Just because
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
Closer than this
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
Closer than this

Were you serious or just dazed
When you asked me to forgive?
There's a thing that I wanna say
Will you love me in December as you did in May?
We're falling as we grow
And I can hear the call
Don't you dare love boys that I don't know
That I don't know
That I don't know
That I don't know
Just because

We used to be closer
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
Closer than this
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
We used to be closer
Closer than this

Closer than this

We used to be closer
Closer than this

Closer than this
