Mary LyricsI've always walked on the thinner strings
I always thought unnecessary our conversations, oh
Your mind is so full of red
And tons of trees are running towards me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh you have to know that

Oh Mary I broke my nose on a wall but
I just found a new cure now
And it starts with a deep deep breath
Oh Mary running away to the river
I love the red of your hair and
I fall in love when you cry
I was born in the middle of the fear
I didn't give so much attention to my education
Oh those trees, they're hunting me
Your lipstick now is dissolved in the sea

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh Mary I broke my nose on a wall but
I just found a new cure and now
And it starts with a deep deep breath
Oh Mary running away to the river
I love the red of your hair and
I fall in love when you cry

But I love the wrinkles of your smile
And when you point your finger saying
"Who he thinks he is?"
Please forgive me I had storms in my mind
I still remember when you used to have long hair

Oh Mary I broke my nose on a wall but
I just found a new cure and now
And it starts with a deep deep breath
And Mary running away to the river
And I love the red of your hair and
I fall in love when you cry

I fall in love when you, Mary
I fall in love when you cryEmbed
