Golden Days LyricsGolden days
Red long nights
Don't be afraid
Don't think twice
I'll be here by your skin
In California my old dream
Feel the bound on my mouth
I'm afraid
I go now
Rip and puff
Kiss and suck
Can't believe my good luck
Stay right here
Don't you go now
(So your boy will never know)
Stay right here don't you go now
So your boy will never know
So your boy will never know

Golden days
Red long nights
Don't be scared
It's alright
Hard pain
Soft bite
On my skin you feel the fight
Wet dreams
Sunrise
Now we see in your eyes
No more boys' games
By now we already know your name
Your name

Stay right here
Don't you go now
(So your boy will never know)
Stay right here
Don't you go now
(So your boy will never know)
Stay right here
Don't you go now
(Cause you left me all alone)
Stay right here
Don't you go now
Don't you go now babyYou might also likeEmbed
