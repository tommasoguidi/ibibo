Hurricane LyricsYou said lay down now
Don't you see?
Devil's eyes're on you
It's time for you to kneel
I fade off this time
Your Lipstick drooled
On another cheek tonight
So hey spits your last words
Keep on
Cause no one can hear
No one can hear
We are a hurricane
We are a blaze we are the fire
We are a hurricane
Running in place
Don't care about the pain
We are a hurricane

My life is snuffing
My hands are trembling
My soul is yelling
So damn, I'm gliding off
Through the basement voices ,whispers
Whats the fucking door I'm going to knock on ?
Shining eyes into the dark
Somebody find me a place to hide
Put ya hand on my eyes
So i can't see what you've done

We are a hurricane
We are a blaze we are the fire
We are a hurricane
Running in place
Don't care about the pain
We are a hurricane
You might also likeI like the way that you're feeling the feelings in everything that i say
Kinda the feeling i have when we lie everytime on my bed
But im too tired
I can't even sleep
I can't even cry
I love when u hate me, girl
I love when you smile
I love when u fake it, girl
I love when u lie
You're killing me slowlyEmbed
