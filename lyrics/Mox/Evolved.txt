Evolved**+ Lyrics[Intro]
Keva *Producer Tag*

[Hook]
Ay! Niggas say I changed I just tell 'em I evolved
Hundred on my neck and wrist, I think that I'm a boss
Seven for a shot, I think I need to raise the cost
You came for my neck that's why you niggas fucking lost
Ay! Niggas say I changed I just tell 'em I evolved
Hundred on my neck and wrist, I think that I'm a boss
Seven for a shot, I think I need to raise the cost
You came for my neck that's why you niggas fucking lost
[Verse]
I did this shit all on my own
You trying to copy my wave
I've been working since I was alone?
You've been trying to do anything to intimidate, uh
I am not scared of you anyways, uh
I could go body you any day, uh
I sip the Henny with lemonade, uh
Yuh, yuh, two flames when I get in thе booth, ay
I bring the energy riding a nеw wave
Better get me a hoop, ay
I ballin' on everyone harder, need two chains
Better tell 'em my mood changed
I do not give a fuck about what you say
I be sipping that do-say, I'm sipping that do-say
(Yeahhhh)
I think the moment that I write this
Now they gonna bite this
They can never fight this
That's how life is
Sharper than a knife is
I've been in the studio I'm working on a night shift
Gotta get a light stand
Get up in my zone now and I'm in my zone now
Better leave me alone now yeah
You go with the fucking flow now
Getting all the hoes now, getting all the hoes now yeah
