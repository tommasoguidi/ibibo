RunAway!!! Lyrics[Intro]
Ya, ay (ya), ay

[Chorus]
I ain't never been the type of nigga that would runaway
I will never take a loss, can’t get it done, I'll find another way
I stay locked in, never gave a fuck 'bout what the others say (ya)
Look at everything I’ve done today
Look at all that I got comin', ay, I'ma tell 'em like
I ain't never been the type of nigga that would runaway (ya)
I will never take a loss, can't get it done, I'll find another way
I stay locked in (ay), never gave a fuck 'bout what the others say
Look at everything I’ve done today (ya)
Look at all that I got comin’, ay, I'ma tell ’em like
[Verse]
First thing's first I got out of the abyss
Thanos with the fist, cookin' with the wrist
Comin' from the mist, they like "who is this?"
Did it from a wish, ya
I been workin’ on my karma
Chillin' out in the car like a Barbour (ya)
I ain't graduated college
But it feel like I'm comin' out of Harvard, ay (ya)
Tapper I'm gettin', I'm comfort and honestly
This shit is prophecy, written my knowledge and wisdom
Determine, I'm beatin' while they all just lookin' so poverty stricken, ya
Hold up, wait up, I'm the GOAT
Feel like Kodak, man I'm drivin' that boat (huh?)
Do a show, I need a quote
Everything I fuckin' spit is a quote (ya)

[Bridge]
In my mind, got a lot of pay
I don't care what you say
Thinkin' tight, I just love to hate
I'm like, what you say?
Percocet, used to pop
But I don't pop no percocet
They gon' wonder how the fuck I did it
Really, I'm just sayin'

I ain't never been the type of nigga that would runaway
I will never take a loss, can't get it done, I'll find another way
I stay locked in, never gave a fuck 'bout what the others say (ya)
Look at everything I've done today
Look at all that I got comin', ay, I'ma tell 'em like
I ain't never been the type of nigga that would runaway (ya)
I will never take a loss, can't get it done, I'll find another way (ahh)
I stay locked in, never gave a fuck 'bout what the others say
Look at everything I've done today (ya)
Look at all that I got comin, ay

[Outro]
In my mind, got a lot of pay
I don't care what you say
Thinkin' tight, I just love to hate
I'm like, what you say?
Percocet, used to pop
But I don't pop no percocet
They gon' wonder how the fuck I did it
Really, I'm just sayin'1Embed
