No Cap Lyrics[Chorus: KC Purp]
Running from the feds, not scared
I'm the only one that got spared, ay
You know I ran, fuck a ticket
I hold out on yo bih’ for a minute, ay
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it, ay
I get the sauce and I drip it
I get the sauce and I drip it, ay
No cap, no cap
I be sending shots like a gat, ay
No cap, no cap
I’ma put my city on the map, ay
[Verse 1: Moxas]
I'ma put my city on the motherfuckin' map
Bitch fuck around, shit could get tragic, you don't want static
I be getting higher than an addict
Make you disappear, not magic, um
Bright white letterman, hoping it's not Vetements
I'm-I'm better than better, it's quite evident
This my city, I’m repping for my residents
Did this shit ’cause I done seen it all, I mean it all
The weeks on the streets, we balled all season long
I need to release my wrongs, relive my rights
I write, and I live my rights
You in a vice
My name really in the Vice
Because I-I put a new Patek on my right wrist
I'm-I’m always going in on the whitelist
I-I take a bite of meat, like a shark did
Moving with the iron, man, I really want to start shit
(Fuck fuck) Fuck an M4, need a Keyblade
Crew full of stars, niggas thinking they can see space
We lay heat on the beats every weekday
We pray one of these days, we gon' see cake
What did he say?
I'm one of a kind. I'm ridding my side. You’d better resign
I'm losing my mind. They really got me thinkin' that I gotta provide
A little bit of wicked when I'm writing my rhymes
Bitch I'm too advanced, my fluid dance is gonna put you in trances
Knew the man, for me, nigga, who the man?
You get lanced, no I don't do the xans
I'm like
Ok, said it better than me, nigga, no way
Only wet on me like snowflake
Everybody so fake
I be cooking beef with the romaine
Step in my way, better rotate, yuh

Running from the feds, not scared
I'm the only one that got spared, ay
You know I ran, fuck a ticket
I hold out on yo bih' for a minute, ay
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it, ay
I get the sauce and I drip it
I get the sauce and I drip it, ay
No cap, no cap
I be sending shots like a gat, ay
No cap, no cap
I'ma put my city on the map, ay
No cap, no cap
I be sending shots like a gat, ay
No cap, no cap
I'ma put my city on the map, ay

[Verse 2: KC Purp]
I'm-I'm-I'ma put my city on the radar
Stay hard
Snakes in the grass but my farm make a State Farm
Nova in the Wraith, but I always say space car
I'ma hit the moon, gotta get my ass stay far, ay
I don't want beef with these lames
I'm different, I stay in my lane
I want a Plain Jane
Bust down a Rollie, it weighs like a train
Keep on extending my range, yuh
Working when the moon on night shift
Key on making moves while you only make a slight shift
I control the wave, but I know you'll never try it
Taking what I want, no, I'm never gonna buy it
I-I put a new Patek on my right wrist
I'm-I'm always going in on the whitelist
I'm-I'm circling your head like a cyclist
Punch him in the face, and I'm back with the iron fist
Drum-Drum-Drummer off the dock with the right fish
Hope you get the memo, sending shots like we're ISIS
Take a pussy clout, 'cause the clout make it priceless
Shoot 'em in the face, no case if you're lifeless
I spin off the shit, off the Ritalin, uh
Deep for the meaning, I'm riddling, uh
We get the most, they ain't fiddling
Fry him alive, leave him smoking and sizzling, uh
Huh?
I leave him smoking and sizzling
Drip from my walk, leave it drizzling
Head honcho, I'm a villain, ay
Head honcho, got 'em stealin', ay
I'll stack these bills to the cieling, ay
I use your album as kindling, ay
Fast like a foul, my ding-a-ling, ay
[Chorus: KC Purp]
Running from the feds, not scared
I'm the only one that got spared, ay
You know I ran, fuck a ticket
I hold out on yo bih' for a minute, ay
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it
Walking in the streets and I'ma get it, ay
I get the sauce and I drip it
I get the sauce and I drip it, ay
No cap, no cap
I be sending shots like a gat, ay
No cap, no cap
I'ma put my city on the map, ay
No cap, no cap
I be sending shots like a gat, ay
No cap, no cap
I'ma put my city on the map, ay1Embed
