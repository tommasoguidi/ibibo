Flow God Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I'm the flow god
Ayy, uh

[Verse]
Got bored and felt like writing this, working on my likeness
A lot of rappers are biting this, fire is where the hydrant is
Never popping a vicodin, I just stick to this writing shit
Writin' this is so priceless, leavin’ any beat lifeless
I'm the chef in the kitchen, I'm just steadily rippin'
Over heads I be steppin’, see no discrepancies spittin'
No Camaro, no confetti, I got bread, I be whippin'
I be fly and you niggas plain, I’m not talking ‘bout pigeons
Yeah, you don’t get it, then you whack acting
’06 boy living on my past actions
So sick boy living on my fast rapping
Oh shit boy they spit it, they lack passion
I'm assassin, but they back stabbing
I'm finna crack past and I’m giving 'em back spasms
I can do this all day and all night
I’ll say it alright all day or all light
All peg’em all k’s and I’ll make them all tight
I’ll stay in y’all faces, if y’all let me go bite
But I'm on it really, they jocking it, 'cause they all inspiid
I'm rocking with it, I gotta get it, I'm kinda wicked
I'm not a critic, but y'all spitting that awful shit
And I kinda be sick and man got some bitches, but not committed
Walk up in the label and I submit it, I'm not convicted
Off with it, hot is what I emit 'cause I’m fire-spitting
I admit it, they peep my dialect and they try to get it
Try again, 'cause my flow's so hella dope, even I'm addicted
Way I spit it, got them yelling, "Oh God"
They know when I get inside the pocket, I'm a flow-You might also likeEmbed
