Curse Lyrics[Intro]
I might break my-
Red Drum on the beat
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Never look at me the wrong way
Run up on ‘em in the broad day
Came up from nothing the long way
Never actin old, never Broadway
I spit a venom and send em at high key
Never been a nigga that's been at a high Fi
Finna be the one that been taking your wifey
And I know she loving the way I recite these lines
[Verse 1]
I get a clip and I’m bustin' *gunshot*
When I get to bust, and I gotta rip it up, gotta get it so disgustin' (uhhhh)
Get a bit of rough and then put ‘em in the oven
And givin’ a concussion
With the verse the wicked words
And give them verbs, I gotta give them verbs
I spit it burns, I gift the Curse, and crypt it hurts they sittin curse-
Eenie meiney miney, tiny hoes up on my dick I think I'm ‘bout to bone em
Eenie meiney miney mo, the king's up in the game I'm ‘bout to come dethrone him
Gotta bite about to cut my throats, it's fuckin' gross
My level dig enough they close, I bust they nose
For my [?]'s fuckin' ghost, but now they always hittin’ me up on my fuckin’ phone-

[Fast Part]
Innovative so I gotta elevate a lil bit
A generator with all this energy
I'm bouta hit ’em with a it
I've never been a citizen
I've been a general, a general, they mimic and they really got the minimal!

(Huh, Yeah) Forecast? Fire rainin' from the sky huh
Bars you can’t handle like bike
Fuckin with us? You can die huh

[Chorus]
Never look at me the wrong way
Run up on ‘em in the broad day
Came up from nothing the long way
Never actin old, never Broadway
I spit a venom and send em at high key
Never been a nigga that's been at a high Fi
Finna be the one that been taking your wifey
And I know she loving the way I recite theseYou might also like1Embed
