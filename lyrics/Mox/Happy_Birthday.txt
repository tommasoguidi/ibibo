[Verse 1]
Ninety percent of people are just fake woke
Spend eight hours in a cage, though
Workin' tryna profit from something they really hate bro
Just so they can pay to live inside of a space
Where they ain't workin' on nothin' but chillin' lettin' the day go
Ain't no angel I'm not havin' no halo
Still let in ring above your head when I spray it though
If you got something to say then you should say it, bro
Usually a giver but this time I came to take, Happy Birthday
[Bridge]
(yeah) Man, Happy birthday

[Verse 2]
(yeah) Look, as I'm lookin' in your eyes you can not fool me with your disguise
Or did I report to you something that's got you mortified
Get a piece of paper and write down the things in your life
That you've done to help someone when they weren't feelin' organized
Live a little, you're alive
You can take this shit or decline
You can live by other laws or you can work on your design
For your life
Look what the fuck the media glorifies
You are either helpin' the problem or you're supplyin' Happy Birthday

[Bridge]
(yeah) Happy Birthday

[Verse 3]
(yeah) And even on my worst day
I run the game and I'm in first place
Y'all know I been workin'
There's never a day I'll work (ay)
If it's on somebody else's watch or in the work place
I am not an slave and man I put that on my birth place
If I see you poppin, obnoxious tryna disperse hate
Hit 'em with a hook then pull it back like "how that hurt taste?"
I been livin' good, but livin' good in the worst way
I've never had somebody that would tell me Happy motherfuckin' Birthday

[Bridge]
Man, Happy motherfuckin' Birthday
(yeah) Please tell me Happy motherfuckin' Birthday
(yeah) Like all I really need's Happy motherfuckin' Birthday

[Verse 4]
(ay) Look, like I've been away but I'm back now
And they know I've been rippin the track down
And I never be quittin' it, that's how
I'm gonna make it to the fat crowds
Like I don't do it for nothin'
I don't do it for the buzz main
I don't do it 'cus I want fame
I do shit for the Sludge Gang
For the Sludge Gang
For the Sludge Gang
I do shit for the Sludge Gang
Gotta hit 'em like a motherfuckin' bus frame
'Cus I'm schoolin' rappers, you the lunch lady
I don't really need a blunt Shady
I been workin' on my funds, baby
We all gonna make it one day
But all I really want is you to say Happy Birthday

[Outro]
(yeah) Happy motherfuckin' Birthday
(man, happy motherfuckin' birthday)
