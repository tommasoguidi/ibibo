[Chorus]
Ayy, what you say? What the fuck you say?
What the fuck you say? Anyway, she my lil' bae
Take her to the bay, out of state
She don’t need no jay, ballin' anyway
Nothin' changed, you get in my way
You gon’ have to pray, for your safety
The gang is out, yeah, we bring it down
Shut it down, what you talking 'bout?
What they talking 'bout?
What you say? What the fuck you say?
What you fuckin' say? Anyway, she my lil' bae
Take her to the bay, uh (At the perfect time)
[Verse]
Where you wanna go? (Uh)
I can take you there, that shit is probably wonderful (Uh)
Wanna know why you ain't keep it a hunnid, though (Uh, yeah)
Really, baby, I'm just tryna crack the code (Yeah)
I don't wanna think about the shit you did to me before
I promise we can fix it, but I think I’d rather leave it, though
I gave you some attention, but you tell me that you needed mo’
Now I gotta a cup of something, doubles what I'm seeing, though, okay
I’m o-fuckin'-kay, [?]
Put my name on a fuckin' plate, do this every day
What you think? And I'm in yo’ state
Pull up to the bank, smokin' dank
Gotta catch a plane, I'ma fly away
Any day, what you fuckin' say?
What the fuck you say?
Anyway, sipping Gatorade, but this ain't a game
I don't play, need my fuckin' pay
Pull up with the K, let it spray
Do this every day, do it every day

[Chorus]
Ayy, what you say? What the fuck you say?
What the fuck you say? Anyway, she my lil' bae
Take her to the bay, out of state
She don't need no jay, ballin' anyway
Nothin' changed, you get in my way
You gon' have to pray, for your safety
The gang is out, yeah, we bring it down
Shut it down, what you talking 'bout?
What they talking 'bout?
What you say? What the fuck you say?
What you fuckin' say? Anyway, she my lil' bae
Take her to the bay, uh

[Outro]
(At the perfect time, at the perfect time)
(At the perfect time, at the perfect time)
(What's the perfect time? At the perfect time)
(At the perfect time, at the perfect time)
(Yeah, what happened? What's the perfect time?)
(In a perfect way, in a perfect place)
(At the perfect time, what's the perfect time?)
(At the perfect time, at the perfect time, oh yeah)
