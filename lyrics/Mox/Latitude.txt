Latitude Lyrics[Intro]
Mm, baby walk through
You already know who

[Chorus]
Aye, walk through with her attitude (Skrt, skrt)
Gucci on her neck, I can't be mad at you (Yeah)
I just do this shit I feel I had to do, Visa
Swipe, every time she getting mad at you (Yeah, Yeah)
And baby got an attitude
Okay, lil' baby got an attitude (Baby got an att')
Shawty on my latitude
Okay, lil' baby on my latitude (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, baby, I've been grinding all week
Please, I just spent some money on this fleece (Skrt, skrt)
I just spent a couple hundred dollars on some weed
I know you want a lot, but, you won't get that shit from me (Yeah)
And they know I'm steady rocking (Rocking)
I be in the kitchen Betty Crocker (Stop it)
When I'm working she be out shopping, Visa
Swipe every time they never stop, I (Yeah)
When I cop a new Balenciaga
Fendi with the Prada
I don't want no problem
Baby pull up with the Murakami like a goddess
But, I just remember she gon' use my card to cop it
Picture then crop her
Bullshit and nonsense, toxic
Imma buy my Fetti, yeah we rocking (Yeah)
Ten whole bands what I give her in the mall
She just came back looking for another option, stop it

[Chorus]
Aye, walk through with her attitude (Skrt, skrt)
Gucci on her neck, I can't be mad at you (Yeah)
I just do this shit I feel I had to do, Visa
Swipe, every time she getting mad at you (Yeah, Yeah)
And baby got an attitude
Okay, lil' baby got an attitude (Baby got an att')
Shawty on my latitude
Okay, lil' baby on my latitude (Yeah)

Yeah, release me, I

Hurt me deeply, this
Shit ain't easy, I
Know you want me, but
This shit haunts me, this (Skrt)
Shit ain't easy, will
You release me?

[Chorus]
A-A-A-A-A-Aye, walk through with her attitude
Gucci on her neck, I can't be mad at you (Yeah, skrt)
I just do this shit I feel I had to do, Visa
Swipe, every time she getting mad at you (Yeah, yeah)
And baby got an attitude
Okay, lil' baby got an attitude (Baby got an att')
Shawty on my latitude
Okay, lil' baby on my latitude (Yeah)2Embed
