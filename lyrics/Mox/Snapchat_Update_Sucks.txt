Snapchat Update Sucks!!! Lyrics[Verse]
It's trill season
Ayy
Man, I just bought a new skin on Fortnite, mmm
Don't want beef, no pork, right
Better have a baby, take a baby like a stork right, mmm
Every time I ball, I gotta score, right
If you keep a score, then you better get a score right, yeah
I don't write no more right, then I gotta write more so I get more right
Better get out my chase though, get out my face
Get out my pesos, get out my ace
Set out to love, but they been out to hate
Stay out 'till nine but I been out since eight
Man, I gotta tell 'em that they fucking with me
Dead
Get a text
Read
Cash out
Bed
Over they
Head
Over my
Bed
Finally think they took my soul
If I shoot make my goal
I don't smoke, take my bowl
