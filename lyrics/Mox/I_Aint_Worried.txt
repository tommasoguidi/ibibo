[Verse]
I give no shits about you niggas
Focused on gettin' my food nigga
Hoppin' up onto the beat, and then killin' it
Diligent, and I'm a rude nigga
I been workin' on the guala
You better not get in the way or intrude nigga
Boy I just leave them all too bitter
They some babies and they need a new sitter
God damn, they chitter, I be trashin' their music
It's too litter
Boy I murder a beat, I'm a rude spitter
I be pullin' these strings, Imma move nitter (Whoo!)
Move nitta, Said it twice 'cause the dude meant it
Murder a beat in like two minutes
So that we do not have a roof in it
Movin' in, and then I'm movin' out
I be [?] than music, I'm [?]
I ain't worry about em
I just Curry shot em, and I hurry
