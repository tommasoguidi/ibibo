[Intro]
I got that venom inside of my veins, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Icekrim bring dat ice, boi!

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that venom inside of my veins
Think I belong in a cage
My nigga pardon my rage
Life is a chapter, they never be turnin' no page
Actin' a fool for the wage
[Chorus]
Sentimental, never incidental
Like it's sentimental, but I'm in they' kennel
Never incidental that I'm in they' mental
It's a foul of penalty
Allow my energy to power up
They thinkin' we came to devour 'em
My life was lookin' down, but now it's up
They lookin at me movin, now it's up
All the women wanna flower up
They tryna' get the Gucci, now it's tough
Had to get that bitch a powerpuff
And just like blossom, she gon' power up

[Verse 1]
45 on the dashboard of my Jetta
Catch the pussy play with my Fetta
My name poppin', I'm next up
All the ex girls wanna text up
Goddamn wait, hold up wait, flexed up
I'm the goat, it's no debate; next up
I'm the man of my city
Got a hand in committee
Gettin' bands, gettin litty'
Understand I'mma get it like
I know they're trying to ride on my wave
Dissin' me, you can get put in the grave
I went to hell and I broke in the gate
My name is buzzin' in every state
If you just hearin me now, then you late
One minute in and I already ate
I do not give 'fuck about what you say
45 racks on my government, ayy

[Chorus]
Sentimental, never incidental
Like it's sentimental, but I'm in they' kennel
Never incidental that I'm in they' mental
It's a foul of penalty
Allow my energy to power up
They thinkin' we came to devour 'em
My life was lookin' down, but now it's up
They lookin at me movin, now it's up
All the women wanna flower up
They tryna' get the Gucci, now it's tough
Had to get that bitch a powerpuff
And just like blossom, she gon' power up
All the women wanna flower up
They tryna' get the Gucci, now it's tough
Had to get that bitch a powerpuff
And just like blossom, she gon' power up

[Verse 2]
I just put 500 up on my wrist had to power up
Enemies suffering cognitive dissonance flipping the script they gon cower
Yup, Ok, I got the sludge, you got powder
Softer than powder, homie you built like you chowder
I'm a monster in a house and this dude not that chowder
I take a shot off my tower
Yeah, okay
Niggas gotta be kidding me
Gotta hit em wit my god-a-ly writtens
Im properly spitting it
Quick, I'm like a lottery winner
I gotta be givin' em hella tracheotomy
Get em all breathin'
And if you believin'
You better better go get you a lawyer and ceasin'
You committing treason
Like what is the reason
You talking all cheap and
You thinking we beefin
You swam in the deep end
[Chorus]
Sentimental, never incidental
Like it's sentimental, but I'm in they' kennel
Never incidental that I'm in they' mental
It's a foul of penalty
Allow my energy to power up
They thinkin' we came to devour 'em
My life was lookin' down, but now it's up
They lookin at me movin, now it's up
All the women wanna flower up
They tryna' get the Gucci, now it's tough
Had to get that bitch a powerpuff
And just like blossom, she gon' power up
All the women wanna flower up
They tryna' get the Gucci, now it's tough
Had to get that bitch a powerpuff
And just like blossom, she gon' power up
