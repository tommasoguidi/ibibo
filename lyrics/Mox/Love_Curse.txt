Love Curse Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, okay

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes, shit don't work
She know me, but I don't know her
Cocaine in her nose, 'cause she don’t blow purp
No pain, snort coke so she don’t feel hurt, yeah
I rewrote this verse
'Cause we broke up, love songs is a curse
I got a lot to gain, but I put us first
You don’t trust me, and that shit just hurts, yeah
[Chorus]
I thought that you really, really loved me (Whoa, whoa)
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright now (Whoa, whoa-whoa)
I feel like nobody really loves me (Whoa, whoa)
But I know they do, yeah, it's alright, yeah

[Verse]
Okay, one, two, my fanbase grew
I promise that I never will forget about you
Told me you would give me all the love back too
But these things change, now I’m screaming "Fuck you"
Like three, four, I went on tour
Every single show had girls galore
That made trust go right out the door
Yeah, I got money, now I feel so poor

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes shit don't work
She heard of me, but I don't know her
Cocaine in her nose 'cause she love Smokepurpp
No way that she know I got a girl back home, but
I rewrote this verse
'Cause we broke up, love songs is a curse
I had to tell the girl from the show it won't work
You thought that I cheated, but I didn't even flirt, now
You might also like[Chorus]
I thought that you really, really loved me (Whoa)
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright now (Whoa, whoa-whoa)
I feel like nobody really loves me (Whoa, whoa)
But I know they do, yeah, it's alright, yeah
I thought that you really, really loved me (Whoa, whoa)
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright now (Whoa, whoa-whoa)
I feel like nobody really loves me (Whoa, whoa)
But I know they do, yeah, it's alright, yeah

[Outro]
I know it gets so hard
I know it breaks your heart
I know things get so hard10Embed
