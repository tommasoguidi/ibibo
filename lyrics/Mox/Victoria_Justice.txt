[Intro]
​cough Yeah
First things first you got me so fucked up
First things first you got me so fucked up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, I've been so lonely, the bands on me
You're not a friend, you're not a homie, you don't know me
That ain't ever gonna change, decided
I don't trust nobody, not a phase, no lyin'
Everybody nowadays shady, lyin'
I don't need a side, I got a main, no lyin'
Wonder why you always playin' games, I've been vibin'
Told you that them other girls lame, why they lyin', I'm like
[Chorus]
First things first you got me so fucked up
Pretty women at the video, don't let 'em touch us
I was drivin' like a maniac, but you can trust us
I've been feelin' like Victoria, I need my Justice, what
17, with some ice and it crushed up
.38 in the holster, I'm tucked up
I've been tryna find a place that we can go, it's just us
Can't behave, motherfuckers never loved us

[Verse]
They never loved us (What), they never trust us (Yeah)
That shit is fucked up (Huh), I get it, what, what (Yeah)
I get it, no, I'm 'boutta swerve off up the road
I'm in the zone, it's kinda hot, I'm in the zone
But winter cold, I never needed centerfold (Yeah)
I'm 'boutta blow, and just in case you didn't know (Yeah)
I fell in love, I'm not the artist that I was some years ago (What)
We gotta go, I gotta grow

[Pre-Chorus]
Never gonna change, decided
I don't trust nobody, not a phase, no lyin'
Everybody nowadays crazy, violent
Think I'm 'boutta go and take a plane to Hawaii
Wonder why you always playin' games, I've been vibin'
Told you that them other girls lame, why they lyin'
Feeling like an enemy of state, but I'm tryin'
It's crazy, but you know I always hate when you cryin', I'm like

[Chorus]
First things first you got me so fucked up
Pretty women at the video, don't let them touch us
I was drivin' like a maniac, but you can trust us
I've been feelin' like Victoria, I need my Justice, what
17, with some ice and it crushed up
.38 in the holster, I'm tucked up
I've been tryna find a place that we can go, it's just us
Can't behave, motherfuckers never loved us

[Outro]
First things first you got me so fucked up
Pretty women at the video, don't let them touch us
I was drivin' like a maniac, but you can trust us
I've been feelin' like Victoria, I need my Justice, what
17, with some ice and it crushed up
.38 in the holster, I'm tucked up
I've been tryna find a place that we can go, it's just us
Can't behave, motherfuckers never loved us
