[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I used to be fourteen in the crib, tryna be a trap nigga
Now I got me some floor seats at the game, tryna go back, nigga
Got me feelin' like Spike Lee on the wood, smokin' on pack, nigga
Drunk texting my wifey, so I know I'll get a text back, nigga
Forty-five on my white tee, used to have that shit up on the dash, nigga
Got a lot on my psyche, on my mind, I ain't talking hats, nigga
Like I said on that cyphy, when I train, I tend to overlap niggas
Heard them niggas wanna fight me, we gone, I don't really scrap nigga
[Verse 1]
Been through a lot, I'm forgetting to pray, yeah, like what do I say, uh?
I know what I want, want to get it today, yeah, but I've been afraid, yeah
That maybe I want 'em, no longer afraid, yeah, I do what I have to
You sendin' me shots that I never react to, you mad that I passed you
Them hoes gon' need me, get 'em out my face
Cut em' out my VV's, shine bright into space
Comin' down like, sweetie, why you always hate?
She knows it's me, she never could replace

[Chorus]
I used to be fourteen in the crib, tryna be a trap nigga
Now I got me some floor seats at the game, tryna go back, nigga
Got me feelin' like Spike Lee on the wood, smokin' on pack, nigga
Drunk texting my wifey, so I know I'll get a text back, nigga
Forty-five on my white tee, used to have that shit up on the dash, nigga
Got a lot on my psyche, on my mind, I ain't talking hats, nigga
Like I said on that cyphy, when I train, I tend to overlap niggas
Heard them niggas wanna fight me, we gone, I don't really scrap nigga

[Verse 2]
So complex and I feel so congested
We love, no protection, your love, so contested
Love is so complex and I feel so congested
We love, no projection, your love, so contested
Life is so damaging, how can we go plan for it?
Microphones, cameras, everything's so glamourous
Life is so damaging, how can we go plan for it?
Microphones, cameras, everything's so glamourous
