2016 Til Infinity Lyrics[Verse]
Look I'm gettin' tired of bein' under the pressure
To bein' passive I'm stressin'
I'm tired bein' lectured
I'm tired of bein' watched, tired of bein' judged
And I'm tired of bein' dropped
Tired of seein' cops
With they guns up screamin' hands up
Nigga tie behind ya back
You under arrest for drivin' wild, bein' black
This a fact, industry not a friend of me
Oppression literally tryna stop
But they never endin' me
So it's 2016 till infinity
Generally I'm rippin' beats I'm endin' all my enemies
I'm sendin' these shots like I'm Lee and then you Kennedy
I'm finna be bringin' all the heat like an amenity
I'm winnin' see
Thick women I'm into these
It's me but I spit sicker than 10 diseases
Jesus you better butter I'm into Reese's
Smack a track in fact I'm smashin' it into pieces
Damn I can't believe this
He's just flowin' like a god
Shout out to Yeezus
Please just stop takin' shots on the boy
You can never get up on my level
You a toy now I'm playin' with you
And my bars a jerk a tear better bring a tissue
And the cops aim to kill that's another issue
Shout out cozo man I miss you
Wishin' that those bullets never hit and they missed you
I wish you could see how far I've come now
I been juttin' down all these bars somehow
And these haters mad that I'm different
And I ain't all black like the jags that they win
But I'm light skin, I'm writing shit and they bitin'
I'm might win
Tough up on the mic like Tyson
I guess I'm somethin' that you fear now
Listen I guess I'm biting up your ear nowYou might also likeEmbed
