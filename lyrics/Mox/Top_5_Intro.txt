[Verse]
(Yeah) I hope you feel this shit
Top 5 flow and I still the shit
Been away had to get away went away
Came back and a motherfucker still the shit
Hold up, you feel this shit
Choppin' on the beat I gotta kill this shit
Every time I had to get it I never gave a damn about a critic
I'm acidic Imma kill this shit
Do you get it though? I gotta wicked flow
I spit it venamous and imma chemist with it though
I'm mean I'm gettin' it though I spit it wicked though
(Yeah) I gotta slow it down these haters they listenin'
I'm shining, I'm glistenin'
You that know my name what you mentionin'
When you discussin' on the track and you listin' them
I hate what they pitchin' then, I hate when they pitchin' in
I hate when they bitch and I take them to dishes and plates
In the kitchen and ate em, amazin' em, I'm [?] em
(yeah) That's just my life
I don't really give a fuck what a hater gotta say about what I write
I mean I really do this, it is not a hobby
Spit it fluid while you spit it sloppy
It is sloppy, but could never top me and they try to copy
Knock them out like Rocky
You could never stop me
I am in the game like Usain and you steady walking
Making moves and I'm doing things while you steady talking
Study off me (yeah)
