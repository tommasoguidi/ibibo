[Verse]
Young goat
This game what I'm boutta fucking run though
Too wavy I don't own one boat
When I get it promise all these nigga donezo
Got a thottie I'mma hit it like a drum roll
Gun throat neck flow cut their necks
They better cut my check
I'm too cold, respect
I do own the west
I'm too froze
But next to new gold
Patek, I do nose congest, yeah
They sick now
I spit wild
My spit knock down a brick house
You spit mild
A sick child with a big mouth
Your bitch wild
She came through got dicked down
I just smiled I'm like
I'm gonna wipe their mind with bright devices
Why would you try my likeness?
Nice with the mind like a grad from Boston
Sickest nigga in the game, Magic Johnson, like, uh
I gotta stay with the tribe
They gotta stay with the Nine
Bitches been pregnant a lot
My shit, they banging a lot
I'm like a bagel on top
Bitch, I was made for the sauce
Never complacent I'm not
Focused on making the guap
Too cold, that's two winters
If I feature on a song that's two dinners
So ill, so rude, so punitive
Tell them niggas they ain't ready for my newest shit, nah, ay
Bitch, I'm dumb and it fact
I turn tables cause I'm running it back
If I see red then I'm gonna attack
Bitch, I pull strings but don't want 'em attached, nah, ay
I don't want 'em attached
And I got a lot in my mind and I really wanna relax
I heard 'em talking that shit but it really wasn't that fast, yuh, ay
It could never distract from this
