[Intro]
I might break my back
I might pull up to your hometown
Turn that shit to a (uh)

[Chorus]
I might pull up to your hometown
Turn it into a ghost town (yeah)
Back in the day they was so loud
Now they ain’t making no sound (yeah)
Everyone know I’m so profound
Did it all on my own now
Now I got me my own sound
Treat this shit like a showdown (yuh)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, in my ways, do my thing
Four, five chains
Whipping range
Never give a fuck about a single thing
Gotta tell the pussy nigga you a lame
Pull up jeans (yuh)
Pull up, skrrt (ayy)
Dirt (ayy)
Put ‘em in dirt (yeah)
I give ‘em the work (yuh)
Man, I used to read the comments (ayy)
Now I cannot read the comments (ayy)
Don’t pay attention to drama (ayy)
I’m only focused on commas (oh)
I ain’t never been a comma (ayy)
I ain’t never been a mark
Take a shot at him in dark
Gotta load the clip, I ain’t talking darts (yuh)
I got a target
Paint him in red like he Target
He was a bitch so he barking
He wasn’t here when I started
Why in the fuck was you tryna eat on my market, market
I be making movies, all these niggas they be painting they picture in marker
They know my heart getting darker
They know my heart getting darker, darker (yeah)

[Chorus]
I might pull up to your hometown
Turn it into a ghost town (yeah)
Back in the day they was so loud
Now they ain’t making no sound (yeah)
Everyone know I’m so profound
Did it all on my own now
Now I got me my own sound
Treat this shit like a showdown (yuh)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, in my ways, do my thing
Four, five chains
Whipping range
On my brain
Pop no Xans
Not my thang
At my show
With my gang
We go cray
We get laid
We get pay
We get money or we get pay
We get pay (yuh)
