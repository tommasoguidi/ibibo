AUNTIE KILLER!!! Lyrics[Intro]
From the rooted booted
From the rooted tooted
Not a human, druid
I exuded mutant
Looking Cruel and Loopis cause I really do this
I am never wounded 'cause
I'm too invincible

[Bridge]
*Incoherent speech*
Put a lot of reverb on the ad-libs!
Ohhhh okay okay
O-O-Oaker
*Overlapping speech*
Underground underground
Yeah (Uhmmmmm okay okay)
[Hook]
Imma do a show
Miss the cat bitch then I had to
Do a different show with a bad bitch (huh)
Don’t quit me I'm fucking savage (huh)
You could never put your fucking city on the map bitch (huh)

[Verse 1]
Futuristic flow I'm stupid mystical
The stupid critic though
I step into the show
Recruit my digits and I do admit it though
I’m too religious when it comes to getting dough
I’m getting bitches
They been getting bloody hoes
I’m too predictable
And you really are just a student
Listen bro you do not want to catch
A cubic fist 'cause it'll ruin chin and
Bro
I promise that I’m good
I’m too object-able
Concluded with the flows
I’m fluid with the flow

[Chorus]
I’m suited booted
From the rooted tooted
Not a human, druid
I exuded mutant
Looking Cruel and Loopis cause I really do this
I am never wounded 'cause
I'm too invincible

Like I said it nigga
You a student
Better move it move it
Cause the dude a principal
I do the maximum they do the minimal
I move a lot of bank
I'm moving intervals
The sludge in my blood it is blue
And integral
This stupid silly hoe be stalking me
It is like Cupid hit em with his cutest
Missile bro
I’m selling weed I call it moving mistletoe
And yeah
Stop, I am a poet they know it
I am the glow it
Claiming you hard but you never will show it
You know it

I get that a fanbase, I grow it
Getting that money I’m flowing
Getting that cash cause I’m flowing
Everybody already know that I am the
GOAT in this motherfucking game (Goat in the game)
Other these niggas they lame (They lame)
Coming up in they brain (They brain)
Everything I spit insane (Huh)
Quarter of them think I’m insane
Wait
