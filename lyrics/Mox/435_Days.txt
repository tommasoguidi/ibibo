435 Days LyricsYeah
Yeah

Four-hundred-thirty-five days
Wasted with you and I'll never get it back but
Now that I got you outta my face
Think I'm going crazy, had to tell a hoe
Back up, back up
I ain't running on the track but you better stay between the lines
Won't catch us, catch up, put the lemon in the [?]
Really get to whipping shit, I'm feeling like a chef, what?
I could never let nobody else in now
I don't trust nobody, everybody lyin' what's up
She a baddie then I turn into a friend now
No I never love you so I'm probably gonna
Mess up, mess up
I ain't know it was a war with you baby, why did you tell me
That I should bеst up? I don't wanna sit and bicker
With the argument, why thе fuck you always lying?
Just fess up right now, you ain't gotta tell a lie no more
No way no, I'll just fess up
And I know you only lying 'cause you want me still
But I'm sorry, I've been working on the next one
Vroom vroom, not a Tesla, riding
I'm burning gas in the whip, just vibing
I don't really do dates, just dining
That way I'm never late, sip and winding
Why the fuck you always crying and whining and lying?
And I had to cut her off like bye then
Four racks on the chain just diamond
Maybe like [?]
Four-hundred-thirty-five days
Wasted with you, I don't really wanna waste no more
Got you outta my face
And now I'm in the club, I don't wanna feel my face no more
Oh, I don't wanna feel my face no more
I told you I don't wanna feel my face no more
Liquor, I don't really need to chase no more
'Cause I don't really wanna feel my face no more

Ay, I'm loyal to the finish, you turned me to a menace
You wasted hella minutes, my new girl British
Your boyfriend skittish, just snitched like quidditch
I'm smoking on that Yiddish, I had to go replenish
The Henny that I'm sipping on wicked
And if you were a memory you know that shit diminished (it's gone)
But back in the beginning I knew I had a plan
And now they always see me winning (yeah, it worked out)
They don't want me balling like LeBron now, ay
Every time I drop another song now, ay
Yeah, you hurt me but you gone now, ay
Why I got a text from your mom now? Ay

Now you want me, like no way
I be screaming out "just go away"
Never knew you could be so fake
No, I never fuck with no snake

Wasted with you, I don't really wanna waste no more
Got you outta my face
And now I'm in the club, I don't wanna feel my face no more
Oh, I don't wanna feel my face no more
I told you I don't wanna feel my face no more
Liquor, I don't really need to chase no more
'Cause I don't really wanna feel my face no moreEmbed
