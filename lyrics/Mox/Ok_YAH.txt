[Intro]
Haha, okay
Yeah
Whoo!

[Verse 1]
Okay, got, gotta chop a beat though when I get up in the middle of it
Gotta get a little bit of liquor
I deliver wicked sick and bitches shaken like a sticker with it
They know I will never be stoppin' and man I be steadily rockin' it and I'm shinin' like a skittle with it
Literally gotta eliminate, 'cause they know I intimidate
Man my lyrics like a riddle with it (Whoo!)
Young boy just put a lack in (Uh)
Got your main thotty in the back (uh)
Man they bite like arachnid (uh)
Flow come straight from Iraq then (uh)
I just be hittin' it with the backspin
Literally rippin' this beat we throw the rack in
Crackin' never be lovin' no thotty laughin'
Never addin' up but they tryin' to do the math then (yah)
[Hook]
Okay yah, okay yah, okay, okay

Got that henny I be sippin' it
I'm just lettin' her lip on it
I be packin' a brick in it
In my phone they be rippin' it
Henasy Imma swim in it
Energy what I'm givin' it
This is only the beginin' and only we could be in it
And crazy lavish, I'm living in heaven
I'm not a citizen, think it's fake well it is and I'm countin' up all my dividends
(Whoo!) Okay, okay, tell them to fall back rogain
And I'm about to blow like propane
Pull up in an Uber tell the  Bih (Bih) no way
