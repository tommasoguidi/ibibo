[Intro]
This makes me so... sad

[Chorus]
Everybody love talking on my name
Tell 'em all get off my dick
I done made my own lane now
Everybody tryna copy, they are just my kids
I don't give a fuck if you talking a lot
Imma pull a blade straight into his ribs
Everybody talking no cap, no cap all the time
But i pull up and it's looking like a lids (yuh)
Everybody love talking on my name
Tell 'em all get off my dick
I done made my own lane now
Everybody tryna copy, they are just my kids
I don't give a fuck if you talking a lot
Imma pull up a blade straight into his ribs
Everybody talking no cap, no cap all the time
But I pull up and it's looking like a Lids (ay)
[Verse]
Fuck niggas, what i leave in coffins (oh)
Pussy boutta leave the talking
IV, what you needle tossing
Believe that I leave 'em coughin
Sneeze, I'm toxic
Please just stop it (yuh)
Need to watch your tweets, who's talkin
See you mention me, I'm off it
Be the boss, dont need a offer
See the blogs and me's the topic
Drop some shit and he gon' bump it (look)
Look, got a lot of Rital, she see the pickle
She want a nibble, she suck on me just like a skittle and then I dip out
[?]
I kinda feel like malcolm in the middle, I'm sentimental
Never show no love to any fuck niggas
Got an army so you better duck, nigga
Daffy, laffy taffy, give a fuck nigga
Load it up you know it's in the truck with us

[Chorus]
Everybody love talking on my name
Tell 'em all; get off my dick
I done made my own lane now
Everybody tryna copy, they are just my kids
I don't give a fuck if you talking a lot
Imma pull a blade straight into his ribs
Everybody talking no cap, no cap all the time
But i pull up and it's looking like a lids (yuh)
Everybody love talking on my name
Tell 'em all; get off my dick
I done made my own lane now
Everybody tryna copy, they are just my kids
I don't give a fuck if you talking a lot
Imma pull a blade straight into his ribs
Everybody talking no cap, no cap all the time
But i pull up and it's looking like a lids (ay)
