NovacayN Lyrics[Hook]
Codine I don't sip (ay)
Trust me it is not a drought
Sludge gang on my zip (yeah)
We don't gotta talk about
Wanna ride in my whip (huh)
I just got em talkin' now
I gotta get a grip
My, mind I almost lost it now
They think that we friends (ay)
I don't even know they names
Said they wanna chill (nah)
Trust me boy I know the game
I went through the grind (ay)
Y'all don't even know the pain
Guess I had cope (my)
Bars doper than Novocain
[Verse]
Ay, I'm the best I'm just doin' me
I don't understand, I'm the man
I can truly be the hottest on the stand
What it is, what it really is, cause I got a plan
And a goal to make hella bands
Labels get no change
When I write like that, get it right like that
I don't need a dripper gotta fight like that
When I bite like that, ah man, ah man, ah man in the middle of the night like that
This what I do, and it's too easy
You Pizza Hut cause you too cheesy
You would do what ever to beat me
But to beat me isn't too easy
