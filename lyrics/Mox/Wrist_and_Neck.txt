[Verse]
Always working I been duckin' a deal
Girlfriend out there trying to get to the meal
I just shocked a man, I feel like an eel
Gotta give a little bit of lovin' on the real
Never see you, if you never see me
And you never see me, that's a fact
But if you talkin' hope I never see you
'Cause I'm about to hit you with a slap
(Uh) Young King, Young King
Got hoes, want green
Got money on me, Got bands on me
Got bands, got drums
Nigga got sticks, got funds
Nigga got rich off rap
Nigga y'all got off track
Nigga I had a vision they see it now
Man I just live what these rappers go dream about
Meaning I'm a nigga so hot, I can't even out
I only dress in all black 'cause they know I'm a demon now
Even out, even a [?] can't even out
They hit my phone and they reachin' out
Jesus, how stupid can they be, I'm pissed
Got me screaming out
"Look at these rappers I'm beating, I see em now" (woo!)

[Hook]
My wrist and neck
I got, I got, I got Ice on my wrist and neck

Aye, wrist and neck
Revenge on my clothes
Aye, wrist and neck
My, My wrist and Neck
I got, I got, I got Ice on my wrist and neck
Yeah, yeah, man that boy froze
Aye, wrist and neck
Revenge on my Cloths
