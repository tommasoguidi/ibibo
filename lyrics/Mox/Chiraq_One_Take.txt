[Intro]
Yeah, One take
Malone, look

[Verse]
You all know that I rap movin'
Get dropped quick like a bad student
Even though Imma grad student
I'm flippin' dope, I ain't pack movin'
When I rap fluid I attack wack rap, that's facts
Imma rack through it
I'll body you on your own track, while your baby mama just laughs through it
I rap stupid, Imma rap student
Of Hoc and Big, and lil jazz too
And I'm that rude when I rap dude
I gotta gas spew in that rap music
I'm 2 chains back in '09, never got my chain took though
I'm King Los with the 16, but I'm Lil Uzi with the hook though
I'm Lupe with the freestyle
You old niggas lookin' senile
Do you see now that I be wild?
Say ya name and you should be proud
Imma motherfuckin' livin' legend and I gotta message that I gotta bleep out
Motherfucker steady lookin' for another king and I feel like it's me now
I mean I really gotta get up on a track and then you know I gotta snap
I gotta do it every time though
Every time I get up on a beat I gotta chop it into pieces
I can do it with my eyes closed
That's cause I'm winnin' every beef and nobody wanna battle me
They gonna need that 5-0
Ah motherfuckers wanna battle me I beat em and they tattlin'
I really gotta get it off my mind though
Ain't nobody really snappin' off like me
I be killin' every beat on the hi-key, I see
Motherfuckers need vizine, everybody wanna get up on my team
But this ain't 2k and you fake like a toupay
Better mention me among the new greats
I be making God say touch√©, done (yeah)
[Outro]
Fuck around get smoked nigga
