Acapella for the People LyricsI was chillin' in my room writin' raps and whatnot
And I can rap and whatnot
But I'm here to say shit a rapper would not
This one things happens a lot
Every time I watch the news another black man was shot like
I could get gunned down for leavin' my house at the right time
I get questioned by cops for bein' black at night time
Video Surveillance on me for bein' black at day time
And I'm black who hates crime
But isn't being pulled over for being black a hate crime?
If I laugh or take time it's a gat then 8/9's in the back of my spine
Now I gotta act on dateline
This some shit that comes up often
It's and unfair role we've been tossed in
My moms been stressed out a lot but we talk it
Because my mother doesn't want to see me in a coffin
My moms right I could get shot right on site
For havin' my lights on bright all night
But you should see the way the cops react when I tell them my moms white
I got a lil sis too some big bros that call me lil sis too
And yeah I know I'm little 6'2"
But my sis asks some questions like a lil sis do
She said why we gotta live with this root society
I asked that shit when I was 6 too
Society thinks all us blacks are flippin' bricks too
Yeah the thugs do it just to feed they kids food
They think we uneducated and we all some crips too
But my GPA was 2 less than a 6.2
I'm tired of the government hiding they issues
Go and tell Trump he can suck on my dick too
I see you michaelYou might also likeEmbed
