[Verse 1: Moxas]
Look I got the recipe
It's simple I see her right next to me
We made it because we concentrated and focused the energy
Don't have to think I'm destyoin' my enemies (ooh)
I just do it, like Shai Leboeuf I just do it
Like Pimp C I just do it
It's bitch after bitch after bitch I run through it
Who next up
Yeah you tryna flex what
Think you needa get yo checks up
Tell your baby moma she trippen if she think I want her from the neck up
All I wanted was the sex rubs
Back rubs in the lexus
All your old girls text us
And I'm linking up with quest love

Anyway i think I'm next up
All my fans got the best luck
'Cause I dropped a tape with 20 songs on that bitch
All my bars reclace
Necklace with the rubies in it
In my whip and we cruizin' in it
Her top off watchin' movies in it
Only thing she wear a coophie in it

Damn head was bomb though
I been lookin' for a condo
You ain't lookin' like you rondo
And you bank is somethin' wrong though
I been ballin' bringin' heat and reppin' for Ohio
But I ain't Lebron though
I been snappin' every song though
This Malone with the god flow
Bitch

[Verse 2: Kevin LaSean]

The doctor was sayin' I'm blessed up

Competition got em stressed up
