Nobody Lyrics[Intro]
I do not
I do not fuck wit' nobody (Vizard Beats...)

[Chorus]
I do not fuck wit' nobody
I gotta get to the money
I don't got time for no friends
I just got studio time and some time to get bands
I got a army of plans, you got a army of ants
([?] they really do nothing, they really ain't working)
(I never [?], that is on purpose)
(I got these rappers on shit and they nervous)
I do not fuck wit' nobody
I gotta get to the money
I don't got time for no friends
I just got studio time and some time to get bands
I got a army of plans, you got a army of ants
([?] they really do nothing, they really ain't working)
(I never [?], that is on purpose)
(I got these rappers on shit and they nervous)
[Verse]
First things first, better read about it
They been speaking on my name, don't think about it
Gotta believe that I'm especially gifted
So when I step in, I'm rippin' it
If you talk, you could [?]
You are sheep, you do not grind
And I know I am a god in my own mind
They been sayin' she a gold digger, oh
Gotta know that she gon' throw up bad, like '05
I am a hell of a rapper, they know it
I'm steadily growing
They trying to take all my shine but I'm glowin'
I'm up in the game and I'm ballin', I'm scorin'
I [Wilson/will son] these rappers and I speak and I [?]
And I'm makin' some money because I be flowin'
I tested the waters like puttin' my toe in
But my shit's so hot that it turned into coal
I don't no opponent to speak [?]
I be spittin' this shit, it's especially potent
I'm sittin' like homie how didn't you notice
I'm sick in the ship like I'm aimed at the boat
I'm like how in the fuck am I not in [?]
I be climbin' a mountain like I am the GOAT
And they know I be next, I don't mean [?]
I don't need any love, I just need all the dough
Man I told 'em like...

[Chorus]
I do not fuck wit' nobody
I gotta get to the money
I don't got time for no friends
I just got studio time and some time to get bands
I got a army of plans, you got a army of ants

(I never [?], that is on purpose)
(I got these rappers on shit and they nervous)
I do not fuck wit' nobody
I gotta get to the money
I don't got time for no friends
I just got studio time and some time to get bands
I got a army of plans, you got a army of ants
([?] they really do nothing, they really ain't working)
(I never [?], that is on purpose)
