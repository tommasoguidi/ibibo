Lil' bitch I'm freezing
I cannot leave the house when the sun is out because I'm a demon
What is the reason?
All of the thotties gon' hit up my phone, caught me geekin'
Nigga you peekin'
Weekin'
When you gon' start to me, nigga I promise you I'm never leaving
None of your [?]
Gon' be a body bag, probably I'm tossing your ass in the deep end (huh, ayy)
Y'all know my thottie petite
She might be a vegan, eating
Really she never be eating
We live in Garden of Eden
All of my fans are a legion
I take a piss on a MAGA hat, that is my Pledge of Allegiance
Why in the fuck do you move like a bitch you policing?
That is why yo' bitch is leaving
With me
I give her coca like Whitney
That bitch is singing like Brittney
In a cabana, she wanna suck the banana
Yes, I am talking bout Tana
Equipped with the Xans
But I smoke this tree in Atlanta
Yes I got broads in Atlanta
I heard your bitch wanna sit on my lap like I'm Santa
I got her wetter than Fanta (huh)
[Chorus]

Swerve, switch the lanes (yuh)
Take yo' bitch (yuh)
You a lame (you a fucking lame)

Swerve, ooh, switch the lanes (yuh)
Take yo' bitch (yuh)
You a lame (you a fucking lame)
Yeah I got the plug
It is not a game
I gotta power up
And work on my brain (yuh)
