Kaioken x20 Flow Lyrics[Chorus]
Look, I don't see no competition
Young G.O.A.T., young G.O.A.T.​
Damn, but I got a lot of wisdom
I'm cutthroat when I bust flows
No friends and it's just foes
Never trust those, never trust hoes
Never trust niggas, only trust O's
Trust cash, just know
Look, I don't see no competition
Young G.O.A.T., young G.O.A.T.​
Damn, but I got a lot of wisdom
I'm cutthroat when I bust flows
No friends and it's just foes
Never trust those, never trust hoes
Never trust niggas, only trust O's
Trust cash, just know (Yeah)
[Verse]
Ayy, hit 'em with the rhythm
In the middle of they motherfuckin' eyes, ooh
Promise I'ma make it, any record, I'ma take it
I'ma break it, really gotta feel the vibe, huh
Young Moxas, never gonna quit it, uh
Forbes' list, I really wanna get it, uh
I'm a god, homie gotta admit it, uh
Put in work, quick sellin' with it, uh
I want a throne, I'm a bad man
But I'm dark like Batman, I'm a savage, huh
I slap a nigga with a backhand
Then I hit 'em with the other hand, I'ma clap him, huh
I catch a body, I'm a wanted man
But my flow worth a hunnid man, I be huntin' him, huh
I fuck around and I'ma gun a man
Gotta hit him with a drum again till he stumblin', huh
I don't be rappin' bout guns
I just be spittin' my lyrical weaponry shit
But if they F with me, shit
I'ma pull up with a dagger and definitely slit (Ooh)
I am no Devil and shit
So why am I spittin' this devilish shit? (Ooh)
I'm hot as the Devil and shit
So hot that I melted my medals and shit
I really came up with a name in the game
Every time I gotta spit a wicked flow a motherfucker wanna get at me
I really rip it though, I'm never seein' any enemies
They all up in my face, they're tryna eat up on my energy
They thinkin' I'm a god and everybody really kidding me
And they blowin' up my phone, they really wanna be a friend of me
They wanna be a homie, can I get in my vicinity
I'm flippin' the energy, enemies couldn't get rid of me (Ooh)
