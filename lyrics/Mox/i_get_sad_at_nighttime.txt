[Intro]
I know you so well
I know you so well, so well
I mean I can do anything that he can (rxbin, is this your sauce?)
I've been pretty— (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut it
Everything you talkin' 'bout, just cut it
I ain't really got time for "What if?" I been stunnin'
Steady workin' on my hunnids, I stay bluntin'
I'ma light this up while I write this up, make change, I done it
When I make change, I ain't talkin' 'bout money (Yeah)
But they know I run it (Ayy)
[Chorus 1]
In the nighttime, I'm in the right mind, I gotta write my brain
Write my thoughts that keep me sane, and I hate this pain, but it keep me tame (Yuh)
Ain't nobody really perfect enough, but findin' a purpose is perfect for some
Gotta makе sure that you workin' for somethin', you put in the work, thеn the work gets done (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Leave it all to me, I became everything I got to be
But these days, everything hard to me
I don't even know you, don't nod to me
I stepped out of pain, and I found a piece
I overcame the pain with the sound of beats
I reinvented me, and I found that people gravitate to me when they proud of me

[Refrain]
I got 35 hoes in the DM, they tryna be the BM
But I don't even see 'em, I'm workin' like a GM
I wake up in the p.m., and now I'm blowing up like an ICBM
You can try to take it, I don't know [?]
But I'ma get it back in a second, I'm like [?] (Uh)
Prolly why you pulled up in a Nissan
And prolly why I pull up in the back of a GMC, uh

[Verse 2]
Just sit and I wait for it, 'cause you told me to wait for it
So I wait for it, and I wait for it
But I'm not gonna wait another day for it, no space for it
Got brand new shoe, new chain for it
Got brand new bright red skateboard
I stay move forward like spacebar
I got no time for a hater

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm like, "Just shut it"
Everything you talkin' 'bout, just cut it
I ain't really got time for "What if?" I been stunnin'
Steady workin' on my hunnids, I stay bluntin'
I'ma light this up while I write this up, make change, I done it
When I say change, I ain't talkin' 'bout money (Yeah)
But they know I run it (Ayy)

[Chorus 2]
In the nighttime, I'm in the right mind, I gotta write my thoughts
Write my wins, and I write my loss, I'm in my head at nighttime often
Feelin' lost, I gotta open up a bottle
Been a boss, I'm steady movin' wit' the caution
Two mo' shots, and I'm finna get nauseous
I get it [?], and I'm dealin' with a lost [?]

[Verse 3]
Not great, but I'm not that bad though
Been a while since I been this sad though
I ain't ever think I've been this sad though
Think [?]
But I'm 'bouta turn around low
Get another pound low
Rollin' up the motherfuckin' loud though
But you know I'm in the town though
Pull up in a RAV4
Meet you at the motherfuckin' ground floor
[Refrain]
I got 35 hoes in the DM, they tryna be the BM
But I don't even see 'em, I'm workin' like a GM
I wake up in the p.m., and now I'm blowing up like an ICBM
You can try to take it, I don't know [?]
But I'ma get it back in a second, I'm like [?] (Uh)
Prolly why you pulled up in a Nissan
And prolly why I pull up in the back of a GMC, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm like, "Just shut it"
Everything you talkin' 'bout, just cut it
I ain't really got time for "What if?" I been stunnin'
Steady workin' on my hunnids, I stay bluntin'
I'ma light this up while I write this up, make change, I done it
When I say change, I ain't talkin' 'bout money (Yeah)
But they know I run it (Ayy)

[Outro]
And I'm like, "Shut it"
Everything you talkin' 'bout, cut it
I ain't really got time for "What if?" I been stunnin'
Steady workin' on my hunnids, I been bluntin'
Nighttime, I'm in the right [?]
