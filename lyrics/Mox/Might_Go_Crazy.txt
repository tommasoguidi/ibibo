CashMoneyAp
Okay!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I be looking so deranged
I got venom in my veins
Cut the engine on the plane
They be thinking I'm insane
From the darkness like I’m bane
Homie I done got some change
It didn't even make me change
Now I might need to cop a range
I be whipping, whipping they cannot
Get in my lane, I'm sending shots at they brain, yuh
Probably go over they head though
Shit is a wrap like an eggroll
I just be stacking like Lego
She wanna give me a waffle like Eggoll
They just be be talking like Ted though
I touch a beat and I’m leaving it dead though
I got a thottie she always be giving me X though
She just want me for the checks though
I don't do competition why would I wanna battle
With all of these rappers I'm better than
They just be rookie I'm veteran I just be setting them up
And I'm cutting they head again dead again
I got they lady in bed again and I be getting
The thing that I said again head again
Look at the way that I'm stepping in and
Take a look at the direction I'm heading in
Shit's sick, think I need a vomit bag
She say, she love the way I’m Sonic fast
And I be murdering microphones
And I be riding my bike home
And I be chopping at my show
And it be coming off my dome
I use the rhythm as my chrome
(Pew pew pew pew!)
[Bridge]
Watchu gonna do, watchu gonna do now?
Watchu gonna do, watchu gonna do now?
Watchu gonna do, watchu gonna do now?
Watchu gonna do, watchu gonna-

[Outro]
Man I think I might go crazy, might got rabies, how you hating
Man I think I might go crazy, might got rabies, how you hating
Minimum waging
Might go crazy, might got rabies, how you hating
Man I think I might go crazy, might got rabies, how you hating
Minimum waging
