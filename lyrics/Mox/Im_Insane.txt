[Intro]
Yeah, I think I'm insane
I think I'm insane, Yeah
I think I'm insane
There's something wrong with my brain
Yeah, look, I think I'm insane
I said I think I'm insane
I think I'm insane, there's something wrong with my brain

[Verse]
I said I, think I'm insane, there's something wrong with my brain
Spillin' the illest of lyrics murder a verse with a flame
I take a vail to my veins, I like the frighten my health
I get in violent fights, but find I am fighting myself
I try to enlighten myself, but the might in myself
Tells me to fight with my thoughts
And go grab a knife from the shelf and go on the street
And just creep and find me a soul I can see
Then they cut em up till they bleed and they make em soup and just eat em
I'm crazy
I'm thinkin' maybe my mind is infected with rabies
I get that I'm venomous pictures of villians since I was a kid or a baby
But lately my thoughts have gotten me feelin' a little shakey
I like to make somebody bleed profusely on the daily
And fuck my ex, cause I don't gotta mention bitches though
She get it though, she makin' dollars up on the stripper pole
I'm gettin' dough offa these verses, a nigga kickin' though
I'm kickin' flows, cuttin' up bodies, and sniffin' different coke
And lately I been gettin' higher than a bitch
You dyin' from a shiv, that's required where I live
And I desire to put your body to fire quick
And my attire is rare to buy
You can't find my shit
(Yeah) so hide your wife and kids
I make you liars die by midnight if you talkin' shit
Here I can get a pick or a wire through your shit
And I'm flier than a six, you admire what I live, damn
[Outro]
Yeah
I said I think I'm insane, there must be something missing from the pink of my brain
