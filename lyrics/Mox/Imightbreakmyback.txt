Imightbreakmyback Lyrics[Verse]
Yeah yeah, uh
Once friends, turn to foes
They be acting funny 'til they see you up now
If I'm taking shots at an enemy the only time I bust down
I need a wise woman I need more than figure and a butt now
But I know all women the same
So I don't really give a fuck now
I am meeting with labels and friends
I tell 'em I need mic advance
That's part of the plan
I snap off the top like a can
I pull off this sick like a pan
I'm makin' 'em dance
And you don't have half of a chance
If beating me is in your plans
So stick to the plan
I'm spiffin' on less than a grand
That's why I be livin' so grand
I'm meeting demands
Exceeding they grants
Whatever the season I'm hittin' that tan
They see what I be and they see that I can't
Tryin' to catch up at all but it's over they head and they hands
Shoutout to all of my fans
At shows I be shaking their hands
Like what is the chance
Your girl gonna be in the stands
And I'm like bitch you with your mans
My dick in my pants
Can't keep my dick in my pants
This is a hell of a rant
Balling like Kevin Durant
Funny how they wanna fake on me now that I made it to show that you can't
Better move it better back
Peter piper, pick the sickest spitter out the pack
Send him to me I'ma snap
I'mma hit him but his bloody nose up on the snap
Better believe it
I am a genius
I am a demon
I am from Venus
I just be rapping like father of Jesus
I be flowing like Poseidon in seas
Stop that, watch that, hot rap, pop cap, no cap, not that, bot rap, oh snap
Off that I had to bring the bars back
And I think I got a crown
Niggas be moving like ops, but that shit is not allowed
Everyone claiming they best in the city but calm it down
I'm working aquatic, my level they not it, he fly like a rock, better shut him down, yeah
I just came back with a hitter
Feel like I'm Drake 'cause I'm sick of these niggas
Don't let it get to me, nigga
They need a spaceship to get to me, nigga
High-key, when I start the spittin'
Need an IV, 'cause I'm dark and wicked
If you want to test my wisdom
Come fine me like parking ticket
Not a critic, though
Get it, go
Hella fuckin with it though, get exposed
Never get a minute to pin a flow
But you better hit the dough, centerfold
Feelin' like a beast from the Middle East
Get up on a beat
Have a feast
Motherfucker, eat
Hit 'em with the rhythm and the heat
They be on the preach
Then we get a medic I'mma tweak
Motherfucker geek, hit him in the teeth like uh
Aye
Now they want a photo, aye
Hit 'em with Kaioken, I wasn't trying
But they know I really be Goku, aye
I done made a lotta noise on the Internet they can't even call me local, aye
Local, when I put shit into pro tools
Don't hit my phone I don't know you, ayeYou might also like4Embed
