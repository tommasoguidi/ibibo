[Intro]

Yuh uh
(pull up) Jetta with the blacked out windows
We should take a ride right now
I don't know about you but I'm feeling so alive right now
All the fakes that were hating but they wanna switch sides right now
See me eating they really want a piece of the pie right now

[Verse]
Lit  I can fly right now
I'm that nigga I'm that guy right now
Making money what would I write down
Superfly man the sky right now no way no
My life like a movie okay tho
And my wallet looking thick no mayo
Young nigga with the sauce like Prego
Go back to the booth every day I'm working
Man it's back to the booth
You can never ever turn your back on the truth
Your wallet looking like the back of a coupe
Everyday man it's back to the booth
I'ma make a track make a slap for the youth
You can never ever turn your back to the truth
Sonic boom is with me in back of the coupe ( ight )

[Pre-Outro]

(pull up) Jetta with the blacked out windows
We should take a ride right now
I don't know about you but I'm feeling so alive right now
All the fakes that were hating but they wanna switch sides right now
See me eating they really want a piece of the pie right now
?Jutta? with the blacked out windows
We should take a ride right now
I don't know about you but I'm feeling so alive right now
All the fakes that were hating but they wanna switch sides right now
See me eating they really want a piece of the pie right now

[Outro]
