Gambino Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Uh) Never flipped a brick no a nigga never seen no pounds (uh)
No I'm not the plug but you know I'm chargin' niggas now (uh)
I'm the one you can never jock a niggas style (uh)
Only catchin' bodies when they jumpin' in the crowd (uh)
And you know I do this and kill nobody but flow is the rudest
I'm buildin' a building with boulders like brutis
I'm boulder and bold and I'm betting you knew this
Like damn why is he flowin' so hard
Why is he goin' so hard on this track and he perp
Nah nah nah that boy need church
This nigga outa his mind man lets put him in dirt
You a pretender since the '87 you been strapped like a fender
Fender bender find a fendi finna bender in a track
Finna bend her like a band was when I bent in on the track
'Cause I'm snappin' on the track like I injured myself
Fuck bitches only endin' myself
No fuck no bitches only endin' my wealth
But I'm in the hide like a nigga simple my stealth
So pristine I spit mean this shit is so critical
Nah Nah Nah Nah you niggas pitiful
Criminal when on the mic I'm so cynical
I am a simpleton you niggas minuscule
In a school nigga got one more year
Late nights like one more beer
Malone is just one more fear
For wack niggas thinkin' that it's just one more year 'Til they blow up
So what, show up only pussy they get to hit it is a blow up doll
And you know what I am so sick that you throw up
You niggas won't even show up
Why? 'Cause you scared
I'm rhyming impared
You rhyme like a pear eatin' nigga this ain't fair
Please step up that's a dare
I'm a devil you a fare
Eatin' you ended up like a dare
Uh that's roadkill showin' that the flow still goin'
On four pills knowin' that I'm so ill flowin'
You thinkin' that you so dope are you kiddin' dude?
The name is Malone if you didn't knewYou might also likeEmbed
