Shiraz (Interlude) Lyrics[Intro]
Take four
I see you Michael
Yeah

[Verse 1]
(Okay) I'm ballin' like that nigga born in '63
Kickin' knees, wickedest written, smitten a freakin' beat
Spittin' heat, flame on a nigga if he be dissin' me
Gettin' cheese, why you lil cheesy ass niggas stick to beef
I be remixin' these tracks from the dopest
I got any nigga claimin' rap, feelin' hopless
Half of a dose, you relapse from the dopeness
Track through the most but relax for a moment
[Intermission]
Like, why do rappers take this shit so seriously bro?
It ain't that serious, like you ain't drake
You do 20 buck colabs on paypal
I don't be gettin' my panties all in a bunch when I rap
I just do it for fun, Yes I do wear panties

[Verse 2]
Dude, I'm that wicked
Mad sick and I rap vicious
Relax, kick it back listen to Max rip it
You fags spittin' wack writtens
I'm fact driven
I'm mad given, facts like I'm a math wizard
The best dapper rapper in the game know my name right
You can get left if you spit it, you ain't aim right
Get your name right, ya lady I get yo dame right?
Get yo name hype
Ya credit don't use no change, swipe

[Outro]
Moxas: Straight up, don't spend no money on nobody bruh
Only for you, you and ya niggas can go get high and shit
You don't wanna be the one that doesn't have money
Like nobody want's, like do you wanna be that Michael?
