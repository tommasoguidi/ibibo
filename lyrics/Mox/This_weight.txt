[Verse]
Yeah I just be movin' this weight
Makin' a move and the second I move
And I swear I be movin' that's great
Niggas be lovin' to hate, Niggas be doin' the most
Niggas be jelly as fuck and some reason they tryin' to convince me that you are the toast
I just be blessin' wow, I'm doin' the toast
Who has the crew with the most
I be flowin' like a god now
Hold up wait a minute let me calm down
I be ballin' like Lebron now
I don't really give a fuck about them blowin' up
I'm feelin' like a bomb now
They can never ever find me
I feel like I'm Saddam now
(Yeah) Man I really gotta hit em with the semi-automatic
Anybody wanna talk you know I really gotta get it
Man I really gotta him, so I'm really comin' at him
Whoa, Niggas ain't down for it
And the ask me what you want
I'm like a pound for it
