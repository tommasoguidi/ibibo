No Hook Lyrics[Intro: Moxas and Cvtalyvst]
Yeah
Chris The Producer (Okay, yeah)
Yeah!
You fucking with this? (Yeah yeah yeah)
You want me to go first? (Yeah go ahead)
Okay

[Verse 1: Moxas]
I pull up in something exotic
Fucking your bitch 'cuz she know that I got it
Flicking my wrist in the pot
Fuck around you can get hit with a dot
I never mess up a shot, hitting 'em quick
With the clip of a Glock, sike
I don't really got guns, stab a nigga if he wanted a problem
I just be balling, labels be calling
They think I'm joking, I just be stalling
I don't answer if it ain't 'bout a check
Talking that bla bla bla bla while I'm off it
Yeah, ooh
I got that water and they try to mop it
Yeah, ooh
I just be growing and they cannot stop it
How did I do this? I am a god, I am the rudest
Get money then cube it, homie I'm not speaking of Rubik's
I am the smoothest, I got a thot, rubbing like Buddhist
You can get clueless (Aye, aye, aye)
I gotta go, I gotta move it
[Verse 2: Cvtalyvst]
You gotta move it, stay away like ya'll got cooties
I don't play, 'cuz I do movies, rappers biting like it's booty, woah
This my Call of Duty flow, dot dot dot dot, no uzi, though
I been on a kill streak and I think I am a psycho, woah
Yeah, yeah I got your lady smash and pass it like I'm Brady
I don't talk to niggas and I do it on the daily, yeah
I been on the rise, someone clear the skies, (Aye!)
Walk up in the room, I get all the size (Yeah, aye)

[Verse 3: Moxas and Cvtalyvst]
I got dirty whites, I don't sip no dirty sprite
Better hurry, why? From the corner, Curry, right?
Got that sticky on me and it dance like diamonds do
They just doing what I say now I'm feeling like Simon ooh
Hit 'em with a rhyme or two
Get the green like early do, what's my name that Sonic Boom
Yeah, get up watch 'em stunting yeah, aye
All my soccer plays will make you punt it nigga
I get check cash check all hunnids
Shout out to my fan base yeah they all love it
And I wanna cop the Benz brand new five hunnid
But I think I'd rather get me iced out nigga
Aye lights out nigga aye strike out nigga, uh
I gave the king a verse he said right now nigga, aye
I bet that this the side of Boom they never knew
Trust me it is not new I guess this beat has got
Me feeling extra wavy
Homie just tell 'em the truth, I got a weapon I brought it to booth
I don't got nothing to prove how I'm a ember and got a groove
Don't get it twisted bitch I do not screw around
Sludge Gang 'round the town, yeah they hold it down
I been underwater how I never drown
Yeah, I stick to my room, I don't need a lounge
Yeah, slap 'em with my broom if they dare to challenge
Aye, I do not listen to rules, someone please tell me how
That is the move, That is a fact and you can't disapprove
