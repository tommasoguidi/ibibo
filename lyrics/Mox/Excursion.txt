Excursion Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I said lean (what?)
Yeah, aye, look

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sipping lean on the rocks, high key on the block (what?)
I don’t rock with you because your team full of cops
Not the type of nigga that be beefin' a lot, trust me, no I'm not

[Chorus]
Tryna whip that new excursion (skrt, skrt)
You don't know me, better learn it
Wanna text back, nah, gotta earn it
Only buying shit cause I deserve it (what?)
Tryna whip that new excursion (skrt)
See me on the I-10 swerving
Ten, bad bitches what I been curving
Never been that nigga that was nervous
[Verse]
Yeah, almost signed a deal but changed your plans homie, what
Couple racks on me, ten bands on me what
In them floor seats,  you in the stands homie, what
Ima ball shit ´till nobody stands homie, what
Did a lot, they don't understand homie, what
I don’t care, long as all the fans know me, what
Know my name, really high demand homie, what
Gotta take flight never land homie
Gotta find another way, I did it on my own, yeah
Gotta buy another place, I do not feel at home, yeah
They call me defensive, probably cause I'm in my zone, yeah
You was not around back then so do not hit my phone, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah don’t hit me
Now I’m long gone and you saying that you miss me
Iced out, ice on my neck so crispy
Now you wanna kiss me, I just wanna sip

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sipping lean on the rocks, high key on the block
I don’t rock with you because your team full of cops
Not the type of nigga that be beefin' a lot, trust me no I'm not
Trust me no I'm not
Sipping lean on the rocks, high key on the block
I don’t rock with you because your team full of cops
Not the type of nigga that be beefin' a lot, trust me no I'm not
