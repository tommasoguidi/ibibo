Grave Danger Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, things change
People see I'm up now, now they give a fuck now, I swear
But I'm diggin' my grave, 'cause they don't give a fuck now
I don't feel the love now, yeah, things change
People see I'm up now, now they give a fuck now, I swear
But I'm diggin' my grave, 'cause they don't give a fuck now
I don't feel the love now, yeah

[Verse]
I don't really wanna die, you don't really wanna lie
Can't hurt but I don't let it hold me down no more
Why it just made me wanna run away
I don't really gotta run away
Lucky I could see another day
Know I had to find another way
I've been livin' copacetic
I've been puttin' all thе work in
Making all the competition look pathetic (Ayе)
I be givin' y'all fire, tell 'em all bye then it's like night time
And I'm takin' your wives, turn 'em all bi
Now they all my wives
I ain't never been the guy that was alright sittin' on sidelines
Heart broke many time but I'm alright, I'ma live my life
I'ma get my own way, okay, really always been alone
Drugs make the pain go away, I don't take 'em anymore
Heart froze, I'm cold
[Chorus]
Yeah, things change
People see I'm up now, now they give a fuck now, I swear
But I'm diggin' my grave, 'cause they don't give a fuck now
I don't feel the love now, yeah, things change
People see I'm up now, now they give a fuck now, I swear
But I'm diggin' my grave, 'cause they don't give a fuck now
I don' feel the love now, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
