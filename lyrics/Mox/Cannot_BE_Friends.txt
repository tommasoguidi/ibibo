Cannot BE Friends LyricsYuh, I heard all your raps, that shit is pretend (Yeah, huh?)
Uh, so yeah we can rap, we cannot be friends (Na na, aye!)
Haven't been working but back in the lab on niggas again
You haven't been popping since niggas was dabbing, flicking the wrist (D-d-d- D-d-d-dab!)

Yuh, I'm not the goat in the game but the goat in my city fo'sho'
Yuh, I see how the following and see how I'm growing they ain't getting close (Haha)
Like what the fuck happened to you, you was popping, man I wanna know (What? What?)
I went to your show, 7 people at your show (Yuh)
(Seven!)
I don't think you understand it, aye
I make 'em all going panic, huh (What?)
I make 'em all looking frantic, huh (Yuh)
I don't want crazy amending, huh (Huh?)
I did this shit but I planned it, huh (Hey)
I'm in the camera I'm candid, huh (Huh?)
Then I'm popping all the xanax, huh (Aye!)

(Huh?) Wait, I don't pop xans and they know that (Yuh)
Snap on a nigga like a photo from a Codac
Gotta make a post, where the phone at? (Huh)
Young boy balling like 23
I'm not 23, but I'm making money kinda like I'm 23
It's a lot of you, but it's really only one of me
But I got the drip, everybody know I run the sea, yeah
I, step in the booth with no clothes and my hat on
Tryna find a beat to rap on (Snap)
Tryna find a beat to snap on (Rap)
Kick a beat and get my snack on (Yuh)
Imma beat you are right naps, hon (What?)
Breaking records but don't have one (Yuh)
Get a check, I get a fat one (Uhh)

Yuh, I heard all your raps, that shit is pretend (Yeah, huh?)
