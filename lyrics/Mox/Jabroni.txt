Jabroni Lyrics[Intro]
[?]
Yo

[Verse 1: Yung Los]
Straight up, I be at the top
Look at these hoes they about to drop
On they knees and get jaw locked
Y'all bitches you love to talk
I come around and yo mouth stop
Typical shit I see a lot
All my niggas we some Black Ops
We assassinatin' them bad cops
[Verse 2: Yung Los]
Fuck y'all you can suck a cock
I makin' move, you a fuckin' rock
Rap game, onslaught
I'm Wal-Mart, you a pawn shop
I'm swattin' bitches JJ Watt
None of y'all bout the red dot
Lil Wayne we got the block hot
She look at me and see my wrist watch
My times comin' your's not
Your ugly ass need a face swap
You a Shrek bitch, you be from the swamp
I got you now and I'm about to taunt
I got yo sister, you gon' be an aunt
I always keep it in the family
I'm so foul they gonna ban me
Keep it Disney we're Bambi
They in the bando with the enemy
They keep tryna plan the end of me
They hidin' out like a centipede
They look at me and I'm the center piece
Sendin' out my sign of peace
I'm buyin' shit, while you got a lease
Always keep yo bitches on a leash
They piss me off, they unleash the beast
I got they mommas sayin' rest in peace
Right when I drop rock a peace
I'm ballin' bitches like the middle east
I'm risin' up that's some bread yeast
All my niggas is about to feast
I got y'all if you got me
We flash like paparazzi
Send a bitch home in a taxi
These drug dealers try to tax me
They mad the bitch gon' fax me
I keep it real no acting
We all bomb, they all fallin'
This rap game is my main con
I don't give a fuck if it don't work out
This shit me, that's what I'm about
I see your bitch and imma end her drought
I got her now, I'm finna eat the trout
There's nuts there, go all out
Toxic bars, you all fallin' out
Fat bitch, she a little stout
Back up, you ain't touchin' now
Send a bitch to go run her mouth
These hoes vicious like crocodile
Love you, bitch how?
You cheated like a Drake freestyle
Hold up, you ain't runnin' now
Hoes comin' gotta block em out
We get em fat, we don't chase em now
We get em fat, we don't chase em now

Yo, uh
Comin' back for that round two
First time had to drown you
Now it's time for me to burn you
Your times due, I'm cookin' rhyme stew
Pig cops tryna guess who
Steady trailin' on hot the pursuit
But the sneak kids still get the loot
To yourself like your own truth
I'm standin' up for the new youth
Exposin' shit cause we need the truth

[Verse 3: Moxas]
Yeah, I'm exposin' shit cause we need the truth (Malone, Bitch)
Watch [?] I'm hittin' niggas, new flows I gotta get it
Man I get up on the beat
You know I gotta be the new Rose
Not D. Rose, my team rose
My old rows are my D. Rose
Shit is easy nigga
Free throws, you don't go as hard as my teams goes
Nah, cookin' shit I got my own flame now
Better hide, I let the flows rain down
And we smokin' dope, you know a nigga got my own strain now
Feelin' super fly and nigga gotta get my own plane now
No change now
Used to go to school in my mamas car but now
I feelin' grown I got my own range now
No shame now, niggas lookin' so plain wow
I be feelin' groovie nigga, guess I'm black and white
I'm like a soul plain cow
I'm whippin', I'm whippin' I feel like I'm up in my own lane now
So trained, how does a nigga do it when I'm fuckin' up the whole game nowEmbed
