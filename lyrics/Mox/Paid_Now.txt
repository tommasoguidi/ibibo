Paid Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Yeah) I feel like I'm walkin' on water
All these bitches be hatin'
Boy I came just to slaughter
That's why they namin' me Satan
I mean I don't pop pills, I just stick to the pot
I can't touch that shit, but I be mixin' a lot
We pushin' bricks and what not
Yeah my homie got lean though
Walk up in this motherfucker
All my niggas wanna buy the casino
While you take a jet out to Reno
Hop off the lyre with a stack
Your girls hearin' me rap
I make her sing like Gambino
Phony homies claim they know me
They get scar faced like Pacino
All the hoes they hit my phone up
But they cannot get a ring though
I swear I block if it ring though
Like he [?] a D. Rose
Or Waka Flaka the weak hoes
My profit it steamrolls
Boy I just pocket the c notes
Buy some Glocks for my team though
Knock yo socks of like Bedo
I steady flex like a Guido
I gotta monstrous ego
On the tele I'm famous
But when yo girl hit my phone it ain't to tell me I made it
It's Yung Malone
[Hook]
Stop, What you sayin' now?
Mami so bad, hit that macarena
I'm up, it's my day now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed now
Gettin' payed now, we gettin' payed now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed now
Gettin' payed now, we gettin' payed now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed now

[Verse 2]
Hold up, Hold up
Baby girl is this your bae now
Leave that nigga he ain't nothin'
Baby, I'm just sayin' now
Used to hit you on the low, but Baby I ain't playin' now
I want you to be my nigga, and maybe come my way now
Thots is easy nigga, this a free throw
This a club so you know it's full of all the freak hoe
Boy I got her in the bag like this bitch a free doe
I get all the dime, now you stuck with all the free hoes
Her legal look around like where the fuck did she go
Niggas vision kinda hazy because of all the weed smoke
She text him she at home, but really she with me though
When I finished, then I pass her to my fuckin' team though
Niggas hate me because I'm gettin' paid now
When I wake up in the mornin' bed is gettin' made now
By the way my maid's a baddie, I might take my maid down
And you know she really 'bout it cause I'm gettin' paid now
You might also like[Hook]
Stop, What you sayin' now?
Mami so bad, hit that macarena
I'm up, it's my day now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed now
Gettin' payed now, we gettin' payed now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed now
Gettin' payed now, we gettin' payed now
And we don't give a fuck unless we gettin' payed nowEmbed
