Donâ€™t Worry Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Still got it
My nigga
Don't worry about me nigga
Pull up on him, hit a three nigga
Outa bounds, they gonna call the referee nigga
Out in Tempe where the weed
I came out that's what it seems
Shout out my big brother the king, nigga
[Verse]
Talkin' all that shit that they not 'bout
Imma hit em up take the Pac route
50 grand with the watch bout
If I pull up on you, it's like you better watch out nigga
Run a nigga pockets take the watch out
Botch out, please don't make me take the Glock out
I pop out (pop pow) till they drop out
We gon' take the whole neighbor hood watch out
Any way I'm the greatest
Today Imma say this
One day imma fade a way and they made him a sadist
Amazin' I made it way and I'm prayin' for Vegas
Ain't no mistake and they see I'm layin' and bakin'
Where will I take it
I'm chasin' the mula
Tryna be flexin' my dude (uh)
Jeweler supplyin' the coola I feel like I am the rula
I'm eyein' I'm em too (uh)
Definin' my mood I'm buyin' an island or two I'm
The best young nigga from the south side, murder any nigga from the north side
I be up at 10, you about 5
I be ballin' while you niggas court side
I mean you niggas really jokes like the short guy, fired up
Pullin' with my niggas takin' your life, squad up
Lookin' for some haters when I'm poor that's not us
Man I'm feelin' hella important, I ain't modest
I ain't modest, but I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
I the newest killa boy it's like work
Stop dissin' me and hopin' that it might work
Still got it, my nigga
I be up in banks still plottin' my figures
Gettin' hella money, still pluggin' my dealer
You ain't never find nobody that's realer
I kill it
You might also like[Hook]
Still got it
My nigga
Don't worry about me nigga
Pull up on him, hit a three nigga
Outa bounds, they gonna call the referee nigga
Out in Tempe where the weed
I came out that's what it seems
Shout out my big brother the king, niggaEmbed
