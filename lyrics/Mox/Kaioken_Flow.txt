[Intro]
There we go
I only got 7% right now
So Imma just kill this one time
Yeah
One take

[Verse 1]
They say they running the game
But they know I be gassin' so im ahead of it (mm)
You cannot cross me
My team full of stars and we lookin' just like the confederate (mm)
Get on the beat and I bring in the heat
I'm so sharp that a nigga might sever it. (mm)
I'm just be getting the Benjamines
You gettin' Washington like you from Everett (perfect)
(yeah) They know I rule out the measurement (uh)
Murder a beat I'm not hesitant
I give out shouts on no hater no really though I'm only shoutin' at presidents
And my presence is a boast you
And my presents do the most true
Sit them down like the host do
I see through them like a ghost boo
In this game and imma coach too
You need school and imma coach you
Better watch out for I raid on a nigga like he was a roach (ew)
Cause these niggas all be buggin' out
You gon' be swingin' nigga what about
Heard you rappin' but that shit was super bad
Like you brought mic lovin' out
I got drive you niggas puttin' (yeah)
Chop and blow you like a slutty (yeah)
You should write down all my lyrics 'cause I am a prophet
You better study (yeah)
Funny you could never read my though
In this game you niggas easy mode
I be a G and be a pro so be a bro and see a seed and see a hoe
I see a hoe she see the D and see it grow
And she can go and tell her friend to hop up in an uber
Just to see it though and she a show another
Bitch that she gon' roll (yeah, yeah, yeah)
To my crib for the night time
Say she love the way I write rhymes
She was sippin' on the white wine
I keep it short with her like vine (yeah)
