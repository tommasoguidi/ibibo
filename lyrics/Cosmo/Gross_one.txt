Gross one LyricsMy tissues
Feel like aloe tissues
They're just filled with snot
They are normal tissues

My body is a temple
That's why we fuck in it
And you are a genius
You're just not feeling with it

The farmer plants corn
But he grows gold corn
Breaks his family's teeth
The Moral Is: never plant corn
You ask me "are you hungry"
But I thought you said "do you love me"
And I wonder why I heard that
Maybe I'm just dreamy

I'm scared of my feelings
That's why I am reeling
Do you feel it too?
Is it sad for you?
Me tooYou might also likeEmbed
