Shirt Lake LyricsI wear your shirt to the lake
It makes me feel safe
Then I fall in
And I can't swim

I wore your shirt in the lake
It made me feel safe
That was an easy mistake

And then I fall in
And I can't swim
And then I see him
And he starts to grin
And then I cry out
I hope that someone helps
And then I start to drown
I see you start to frown

And then you start to weep
I enter my final sleep
I took your favorite shirt
And wore it 'til it hurt

I wear your shirt to the lake
It makes me feel safe
Then I fall in
But I can't swimYou might also likeEmbed
