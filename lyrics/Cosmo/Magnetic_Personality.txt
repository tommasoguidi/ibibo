Magnetic Personality LyricsThe psychic told me that I was only there
'Cause I needed a friend and she held my hand
And she told me that I was gonna change
But she didn't know what way
What a bust

Everything is telling me that
I'm regressing at light speed
Light speed

I don't still play the guitar every day
Ask me how I am and I won't really say
I got a week's worth of questions, but you answer them all with a glance
I could have seen it coming, but I left it up to chance
I had a magnetic personality once
But I got too tired to keep it up

Single tear, single tear
Single tear, must be niceYou might also likeEmbed
