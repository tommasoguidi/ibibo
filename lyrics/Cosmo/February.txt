February LyricsIt was February, it was June
It was August, with you
I do, I do, marry you
I did, I did, but I was just a kid
I won't, I wonâ€™t tell anybody
What you told when you sat next to me
Nothing new, a hug and a drink from you
Then you flew, fountain of youth
And a cup of milk
The pages of my book
February
Another risk you took
February there was nothing near me
I couldn't see, I was watching drunkly
And a cup of milkYou might also likeEmbed
