Grizzle never dies LyricsYou said always
I said never
I took your hand like a feather
You tolerate me, you won't conflate me
Everyones angry, i’m not angry
I miss joey, he doesn’t know me
I got new skateboard wheels, just trying to be real
I saw the future, we’re all losers
Lord knows you’re a charmer, i’ll just be a farmer
You got ur red coat on, what am i doing wrong?
I don’t know what it is, i wanna feel the grizzYou might also likeEmbed
