[Refrain]
I'm back on my crying
Every day I'm dying to let some water out my body
And into the world around me

[Verse]
You didn't look at me at all
And i just stared at the wall
The whole time
I'm like a dandelion
Just a little bit of breath blows me apart
Just standing here seems like a good start for me to cry
[Refrain]
'Cause I'm back on my crying
Every day I'm dying to let some water out my body
And into the world around me

[Outro]
It never stops, this swirling
But honey, I will die trying
I will die crying
I will cry dying
I will try crying
I will cry trying
(But see you there)
But see you there
(Through a veil of tears)
Through a veil of tears
Watch you through a wash
(It never stops)
It never stops, this swirling
But honey, I will die trying
I will die crying
I will cry dying
I will try crying
I will cry trying
But see you there through a veil of tears (A veil of tears)
Watch you through a wash (Watch you through a wash)
It never stops
It never stops, this swirling
But honey, I will die trying
I will die crying
I will cry dying
I will try crying
I will cry trying
But see you there through a veil of tears (A veil of tears)
Watch you through a wash (Watch you through a wash)
It never stops
It never stops, this swirling
But honey, I will die trying
I will die crying
I will cry dying
I will try crying
I will cry trying
But see you there through a veil of tears
Watch you through a wash
