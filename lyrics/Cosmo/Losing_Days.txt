Losing Days LyricsI’m losing days so fast
I shake my head ’til it explodes
It's strange to know that
Only a few weeks ago
I was looking through chair legs
A kid at an adults party
We smiled at each other
Across an invisible boundary

I find love in
The decisions
I dip into my stomach
Like I’m at a bat mitzvah making a wax hand
The walls between
The worlds grew thin
And I felt
Everything
I’m not mother earth, I
Require blue light, I
Strew garbage, I write
Grocery lists, make appointments
I’m stunted in my growth
I hate to hear the truth
My skin is filled with dust
I smear creams on my fine lines
I swear it's not my time

Adam and Eve
Are trying weed
In quarantine
With fancy cheese
It’s not like I’m giving up just
That I never tried to begin withYou might also likeEmbed
