Cosmic Shop LyricsYour windows glisten yellow in the sunset
I got teary looking at the sky again
Rivers fill the sewers underneath you
I wanna be beneath you too
Each leaf blowing never even knowing
What it was like to be stuck onto a tree
Two white doggies do not know each other
Both of them are holding something pink inside them
You're inching up at a red light
I look straight into your 6 eyes
You can break me up, but you can't keep me aside
Like a leaf you shred in two
Has gotta keep on living through years to come
When I need to be made to feel small
And I call you, but you're not picking up
I just go to the cosmic shopYou might also likeEmbed
