If I Had a Dog LyricsIf I had a dog
I'd take a picture everyday
Am I still so sad?
Is that pretty lame?
Everybody says
"Your decisions are okay
But here's a better idea:"
And a comment not about my brain
If I had a love
I'd draw a picture everyday
Am I still so mad?
I guess that's pretty lame
Everybody says
"The first one's just a game
You'll find a better one."
And then a comment about my bodyYou might also likeEmbed
