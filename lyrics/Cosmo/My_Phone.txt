My Phone LyricsMy phone will crash and I won’t even care
'Cause I know you are there, I know you are there

My phone will die and I won’t even cry
'Cause I know you’re nearby, I know you’re nearby

Throw my phone out I know you’ll be around
You’re easy to be found, I’m easy to be foundYou might also likeEmbed
