God, Man LyricsGod, man
She’s always doing
Experiments on me
But I’m
A scrap next to her
Real art I think
She made the sky
Coffee, pain
Equilibrium

Really
Nice curves on that
Lake that she did
Really sweet
Warmth beside me
When you come back to bed
All the time
I’m looking around
A real artist makes you feel sometimes like
She made it all for youYou might also likeEmbed
