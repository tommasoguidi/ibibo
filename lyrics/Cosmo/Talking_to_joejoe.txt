Talking to joejoe LyricsYou are dead can't pat your head
They took you away in a cardboard box
Doesn't stop me from talking to you

I am dead nothing compares
To being young i feel
Old and undone doesn't stop me
From talking to you

Cause I'll talk and I'll talk and I'll talk til I'm really dead
And we talked and we talked and we talked and you never said
A THING
Cause you were a dog a dog a dog and I am a human
Cause I am a dog a dog a dog and you are a human
You're dead can't pat your head
They took you away in a cardboard
Box doesn't stop me from
Talking to youYou might also likeEmbed
