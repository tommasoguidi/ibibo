Weave got it made LyricsMy simpleton smells like cigarettes, welcome to the spring in your step
Today it is warm, somebody call debbie harry she needs to be warned
Daddy’s doing yoga, papas doing yoga
So i’m here collapsing
Passing time passing
And i suddenly slipped into my own memory
Oh the poetic trials of being dimensional
Why flowery boy
Why don’t you climb into me later?
Switchblade heart breaker
My simple boy smells like cigarettes, welcome to the spring in your step
He is a protector wolf, not a preying one
I pray that you stay that way
My boy is made out of hay
We’ve got it madeYou might also likeEmbed
