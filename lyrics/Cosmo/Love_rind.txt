Love rind LyricsWhen the fruit is all gone
And he tells you it is time
Then the time has come
To eat the love rind
The love rind
To eat the love rind
To eat the love rind

I'll be in the corner wobbling
Once again most probably
He'll be the one not acknowledging
That I’m standing right here
Standing right here
Standing right here
Right here
He'll do anything to die
I'll do nothing but cry
Frank the dog sings along
We еat the love rind
The lovе rind
He eats the love rind
The love rindYou might also likeEmbed
