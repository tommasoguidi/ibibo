Yellow LyricsWhen I painted his toenails
I kissed his feet, feet
And I remember you said you're something special to me

Well you know I’ll never make you feel guilty
When I went down the stairs I thought you hadn’t kissed me

You said baby your hair and lips are the same color, color
But I know you were mixing me up with another

Kid which girl do you love you know you can't love them all
When I'm falling in love id like to see inside your brain again
Frantic night
Moon is bright
Silent fight
Red and white

What can I say
To make you go away
What can I start
To make you break my heart

When I painted his toenails
I kissed his feet, feet
And I remember you said you're something special to me

(?By the shacks well?)
Well you know I’ll never make you feel guilty
When I went down the stairs I thought you hadn’t kissed me

Running around
Sky hits the ground
Don't talk about his shoes
????

You said baby your hair and lips are the same color, color
But I know you were mixing me up with another
You might also likeKid which girl do you love you know you can't love them all
When I'm falling in love I'd like to see inside your brain againEmbed
