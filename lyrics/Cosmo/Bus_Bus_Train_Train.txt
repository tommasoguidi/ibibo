Bus Bus Train Train LyricsBus bus
Train train
Makes me think I’m
Going far away

And I won’t
Come home
’Til I’m
All grown

A moment is pressing
I feel undressing
I see a purple river
Wind sends a shiver
Double rainbow
I see JoeJoe
In taxidermy museum

Loving you
Gave me something to do

We sleep like nature
Our love a purple river
Runs through me ancient
I find you in nature

I play the first noteYou might also likeEmbed
