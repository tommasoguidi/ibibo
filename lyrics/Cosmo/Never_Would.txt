Never Would LyricsIt'd make a good song to miss you
But I really don't at all
If you were any good, I'd sing
"Oh baby, why'd you have to go?"
It'd make a good song to go see you
I'd say "Don't worry about him
We're just friends, it doesn't mean nothin"
And he'd say, "Oh, baby, please don't go
Stay here with me and hang out"

But it's not a song
(But it's not a song)
And I never wouldYou might also likeEmbed
