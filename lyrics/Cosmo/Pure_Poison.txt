Pure Poison LyricsLife is a road
Every town is a home
I just wanna be self maintaining
I just wanna stop complaining
I only exist by comparison
I only matter with context
Driving up to garrison
Sad is not that complex
Outside and inside are the same
You got me feeling soft like rain
I thought there was only
One kind of boring
But some people are pure poisonYou might also likeEmbed
