Sky Magnet LyricsMy heart aches at every throb
Renovate my brain while it's dreaming
Vision was painting with clay
An enormous cafeteria tray

What a way to examine how you felt (How you felt, how you felt)
To converse is the inverse of it
Slow train I'll never take again (Again, again)
To sing harmonies with someone who's not even my friend

But I'll always call it as it is
Though it gets harder to see it
You never know what they're feeling
The urge to hit snooze on everything
My heart aches at every throb
Some sky magnet
Has me in its pull, unearths me
I'm just trying to stand on my feetYou might also likeEmbed
