This Stuff LyricsCan you tell anyone this stuff
Can you ever tell it enough
Will it make a difference?
Will they forget it within minutes?

I’m living in a condo
It replaced your favorite movie theater though
Not all trees have fruits or flowers
Some are just there to grow
Not like anyone else my age
So I know why they call partying rage
I’m not like anyone else my age
So I know why they call partying rage
I want to tour in a hot pink van
And I want you there to hold my hand
And every night that you’re in my band
Is a moment they would never understand

Can you tell anyone this stuff
Can you ever tell it enough
Will it make a difference?
Will they forget it within minutes?You might also likeEmbed
