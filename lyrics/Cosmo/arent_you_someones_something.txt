​aren’t you someone’s something? LyricsAren’t you your boyfriend’s girlfriend
Aren’t you your brother’s sister
Aren’t you your parent’s daughter

Aren’t you your best friend’s acquaintance
Aren’t you your hamster’s owner
Aren’t you your dealer’s stoner

Aren’t you that band’s girl bassist
Aren’t you a student faceless
Aren’t you an ant in the cosmos
Aren’t you a Franklin at starbucks
Aren’t you Elaine from Seinfeld
Aren’t you a kid from the city?

Hi my name is Franklin Cosmos
And i am in love with Ronald
And i don’t know exactly who else i am
But i know i am person with my own name

Aren’t you your boyfriend’s girlfriend
Aren’t you your brother’s sister
Aren’t you your parent’s daughterYou might also likeEmbed
