Heed the Call LyricsWater and a sweater vest
I am doing my best
Will it always be like this?
All I can do is heed the call
When you put it out with power
You know I'll follow

I just wanna feel normal
I'm not the same as I was before
I just wanna feel normal
I'm not the same as I was beforeYou might also likeEmbed
