A Joke Lyrics[Intro]
1, 2

[Chorus]
It's just a joke I wasn't trying to tell
What the hell?
I do not know what I am for
I wasn't really keeping score
It wasn't really a game
Flowers don't grow in an organized way
Why should I?
[Verse]
A bowl of sugar and some flower stems
Their spikes growing
I wanted to come from a painting
An abstraction
Calling up Time and waiting on the line
Til I finally say, "I quit, baby"

[Chorus]
It's just a joke I wasn't trying to tell
What the hell?
I still don't know what I am for
I wasn't really keeping score
It wasn't really a game
Flowers don't grow in an organized way
Why should I?You might also likeEmbed
