[Verse]
Are you smiling at me or you baring your teeth?
I'll always have a tender feeling towards the me that loved the you
I wouldn't recognize you from behind
Even if the front of you were my palm
Lean over, fake tender
Like I feel like a man in my dreams
Like I like how I look with you
In my arms, or
I like how you look in my arms, or
I like to look at my arms, or
Look at me, my arms are yours
I wanna be all arms
I wanna be all yours
There's a diamond in your throat
If you leave your light on it was always up to me
Every song is a hit
If you pretend to understand it
