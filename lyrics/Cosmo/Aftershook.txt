Aftershook Lyrics[Verse]
Being jaded and being aware
Poised on opposite sides of the scale
Try to get in the right mindset
But it isn't there, it isn't fair
Thought I saw that the labyrinth
Turned out to just be on a grid
Geometry came in handy
But it was just for me
Me
[Chorus]
Aftershook
After the aftershock
Aftershook
Everybody's staring at us now
Aftershook
Everyone thinks you are just a clown
And nobody is saying to stop

[Bridge]
But nobody is saying to stop

[Chorus]
Aftershook
After the aftershock
Aftershook
Everybody's staring at us now
Aftershook
Everyone thinks you are just a clown
And nobody is saying to stop

[Outro]
But nobody is saying to stop
