Spare The Guitar LyricsSelfishly
I don't want what I see
To be a prophecy
Though it doesn't scare me

I just think it would be a waste to die so fast
And it might make some people sad
But they will figure out life after me
There will be some return to normalcy
The story spreads itself out so suddenly
I can hardly read what I'm picturing
Did he just do it so you'd know his name?
Or was he really just filled with hate?
What I imagine when I close my eyes
It would really make my mama cry
And what I feel when I sing
It would really leave you wondering

Why can I see it so vividly?
Slow-motion hyperspeed
Broken glass
Bloody mess
I know I said something different before
But spare the guitarYou might also likeEmbed
