Youwait LyricsYou wait
Two weeks to tell me
You wait
Two weeks to tell me
And even then
I have to ask
Even then
I have to ask
Hold my calls
I’m digging myself into a hole in the wall
I don’t wanna be
In my 20s
When my dad will be
70
I don’t wanna be
23
When you are 30
I think about you all of the time
In this way you are mine
But I want to be in love with someone
Who I don’t think about all the time
Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earf
Cause he's the stupidest boy on planet earfYou might also likeEmbed
