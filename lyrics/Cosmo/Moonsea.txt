Moonsea LyricsThe world is crumbling and I don't have much to say
We say goodbye, goodbye
Go slow like the train
I hope you know you're not nothing
We've got everything to gain
And I know it's not the same
I'm not in the world that way
At least that's what I'm trying
It's just pancakes on a stove
It's rock and roll, and roll
'Cause I'm the moon and you are the sea
You always seem sad underneath me
All fires go out later, some burn a bit greater
But it's all just fire on my ass telling me love myself betterYou might also like1Embed
