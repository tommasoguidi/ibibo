Duet LyricsYou got nice eyes
They're very blue
That is why
I look at you

I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you

Makin a list
Of people to kiss
The list is a million YOUs long
Just YOUs all the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
But I don't know what for

With my boy ronnie
Listening to connie
I couldn't stop if I tried
I will love you til I die

I look at you
I look at youYou might also likeEmbed
