Dancing in the Public Eye LyricsMy ass is made of velvet
And my hips are made of stone
And if you really love me
You will leave me alone

I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye

The ceiling is the sky
And the rug is the leaves
And my honey fell asleep
Under the Christmas tree
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye

You undo all my clutter
Leave me alone in the flutter
I try not to be pretentious
But I always get embarrassed

I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
In the public eye
I wanna go dancing (Dancing)
