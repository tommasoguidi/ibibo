Joejoe beauty LyricsI am not well-dressed, i look like a mess, and we fuck we touch
You look like a horse, you’re already bored, we’re banging heads on the floor
Gaping twin bed dreams, 5th avenue screams, but you’re beaming between
He’s around my neck, you’re singing what the heck, cause it turns out i’m not what you expect
I know you love me, but sometimes it seems, i’m just part of some scheme
Walked a pretty mile, along your long cold smile, got home safe earthquake
She’s around my neck, what the heck, turns out i’m not what you expect
You’re a beauty, won’t you growl at me, bite my booty won’t you kick me?
Joejoe you’re a beauty, won’t you howl at me, kick my booty, won’t you kiss me?
Just the other day i woke up in santa fe you were growling at me
You’re a knockout in my pink sweater ‘cause it brings out your lipstick better and everybody seesYou might also likeEmbed
