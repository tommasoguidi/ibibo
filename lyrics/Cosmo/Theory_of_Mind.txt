Theory of Mind LyricsI know now
I was too young to think how
You had had a past
Maybe you were affected by that

You called me 4 in the morning
Talkin' â€™bout 2 abortions
I had just turned 16
I didn't know what you meant

And when I met you
You were the age I am now
Your girlfriend has just moved out
Of the apartment where
You said so much nothing
The place that we were fucking
Was probably sacred for somethingYou might also likeEmbed
