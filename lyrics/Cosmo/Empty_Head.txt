Empty Head LyricsEmpty head
It's cool to have nothing in it
It's okay not to sing a song about everything
All the time

But if I did (If I did)
I'd fill up all the server farms (Server farms)
I'd fill up all the iPhone clouds (iPhone clouds)
I'd fill up all the hard drives

So I should keep an empty head (An empty head)
Fill myself up with emptiness (Emptiness)
And try to just take a breath (Take a breath)
Sometimes
I'm always bursting at the seams
I'll tell you all about my dreams
I wish that I could quiet it
Accept a little silence
Maybe one day I'll find it
And I'll toe thе line

I pick you like a coffee cup (Coffee cup)
You thought that I could pick you up (Pick you up)
But I don't evеn have a car (Have a car)
I'm taking you right where we are (Where we are)
I'm at the bottom of the road (Of the road)
You're looking like the line I toed (Line I toed)
You're at me like an antelope (Antelope)
I'm swaying like a grassy knoll

It's the first time I spoke today
And that's why when you heard me say
Hello, I sounded like a frog
I thought that I could pet the dog
But it just wasn't up to me
I hid behind the neighbor's tree
But he wouldn't come out to play
I guess I'll try another day

It's all to keep an empty head
It's cool to have nothing in it
It's okay not to sing a song about everything
