Fragments LyricsWe can never go back
What you believe goes fast
My heart meets a sea immense
The night comes smaller, intense
Freaking out across the trees
Now, love, now I see
That I'm a guitar
Gone too far

You, facing the floor every day
Prettiness that transformed nothing
Here's your chance to stop flirting
With a nightmare
The winds air dried
Another world for you
It's about more than just a
Different shape of a puzzle
Time and space
A translucent weight
Invisible 'til they fade away
Over and over, once or forever
Protect the softer, it didn't matter

I have enough quiet for a landscape
You can view the tunnel in a goblet
You feel like a slowing ocean
One day, we could leave these fragments completelyYou might also likeEmbed
