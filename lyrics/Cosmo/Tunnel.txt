Tunnel LyricsAsk questions when you wonder
In the quick silence as we go under a bridge and the rain stops for just a second
It can feel like a lifetime if I let it
I’m having the time of my life each time that I look into your eyes
You look back at me, we really see each other, the scenery closed off by a tunnel
I’m pretending not to care that everything will go away, but it’s on my mind today
You acquire a new item every time you feel like crying
I used to keep it quiet, now I don’t mind it, I don’t feel like lying
And baby I got hair now that’s never even heard of youYou might also likeEmbed
