Parts Left LyricsI’m home, take off my watch
It's easier to wash my hands without it
I’m sad that you don’t believe in love
Thought if anything could change that it was us

Smoke it to the filter, throw away the key
Give it all away or give it all to me
The difference between justice and revenge
Is there's no justice in the end

In a smaller town than you tonight
I wanna lose my cool with you, I wanna fight
I got plastered with a prophet when I thought I was straight
Your glow gone rotten through and now I’m gay
Part of me so intensely yours
Parts left are meant to be mine sometimes
Losing them seems not to matterYou might also likeEmbed
