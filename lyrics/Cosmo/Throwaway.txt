Throwaway LyricsThere's nothing wrong with it
I’m just throwing it out
Nothing there to try to fix
You would just let me down
I was just being fake
When I said I hope you’re good
Didn’t tell you how I am
Didn’t think you would

You want monogamy
Just to control me
It’s not about love
You hardly know me
You
