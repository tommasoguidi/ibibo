UFO LyricsI wish I could forgive myself for letting it happen
As fast as you forgave yourself for your actions
Selfish as you are cannot be undone
You wouldn't let me let myself become a person
Diamond in your throat, is it in my dreams?
Maybe see you there facing away from me
I'm lying next to you in the strong grass
The car pushes by fast and the clouds are just gas
Everything I know picked up by a UFO
Maybe you too, do I know you?
I want it so bad that I hate it so much
Are you for or against? Well, maybe I'm both
Maybe I'm both, maybe I'm bothYou might also likeEmbed
