[Chorus]
I floated in and started living
Passed a Blondie asked you a question
"What are you doing?"
"What are you doing?"

Now it would be bedtime
If I could close off my mind
It just flops onto you
Wet and soppy glue
What are you?
You know I'd love to
Rummage through
Your silky pink space cap

[Chorus]
I floated in and started living
Passed a Blondie asked you a question
"What are you doing?"
"What are you doing?"
