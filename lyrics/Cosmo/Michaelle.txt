Michael(le) LyricsCreatures crawl into our heads
Sallow boy has shaved his legs
Well if she’s born with the wrong parts
How could god be so goddamn smart?
Aliens and devils communicate
And my baby’s running late
Sometimes when i really feel
I think a god must be real
Pin pricks are annoying but a knife’ll do fine
And the bus never comes but i do sometimes
Sometimes when i really feel
I know god must not be real
Creatures crawl into our heads
Sallow boy has shaved his legs
Well how could god be so goddamn smart
If you’re born with the wrong parts?
All i want to be holding
Is your hand in the morningYou might also likeEmbed
