Is It Possible/Sleep Song LyricsWhen I say goodbye
You act like you want something
Or you're realizing
Is it possible
That I really miss you
New York feels so huge...

What's up with my fate
Is it too late
Or is it going to change
If I let myself
I could go crazy
Or maybe if you let me
Now that I know that every time I get sad
You just hate me
You can go to sleep and sleep it off
Peacefully
I'll be here all night feeling
Totally fucked
Wondering what tomorrow'll be like
And staying up

I guess I just make myself the victim like you said
That's why when you treat me shitty you get mad

It all makes sense now, thanks so much
Goodbye forever, what the fuckYou might also like1Embed
