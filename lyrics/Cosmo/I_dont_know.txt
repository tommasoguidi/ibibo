I don’t know LyricsI don’t know how to sing
I don’t know if you love me still
I don’t know if I am dumb or smart
I don’t know what I wanna be when I grow up

The kind of show that makes me cry
Is changing all the time

I find out what I shouldn’t know
I find out
A weekly
Indulgence
Makes me feel so not gorgeous
I miss

I’m the worst band in the room
I’m the worst friend in the roomYou might also likeEmbed
