Furnace LyricsI feel something for ya
It’s hard to ignore ya
I’m winning around ya
I’m lucky I found ya

You’re making me late
All ‘cause I hate
To say goodbye

I tuck myself into
Your eyelids and skin too
I’m comfy within you
You think I’m a furnace
But isn’t it worth it
To sweat all night to be close?You might also likeEmbed
