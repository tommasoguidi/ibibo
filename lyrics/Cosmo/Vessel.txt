Vessel LyricsNothing comes natural
I don’t feel my body is a vessel
But you seem to
But you seem to

You are a word I made up when I’m high
I gave you meaning but I don’t know why
And you can make me cry
Only you can make me cry

You look like
A cloud drifting off
Am I allowed to watch?
I’m not allowed to watch
Now you don’t have to listen
To the shapes that I make with them
Are you only on a mission
Is it fine that I miss them?

Walking alone in midtown at night
Like fog that disappears quickly, I
Leave no mark at all
Leave no mark at all

‘Cause we move at just the same time
Almost like sex because it’s so fun
I throw my wrists like yours all night long
Stay alive by nodding alongYou might also likeEmbed
