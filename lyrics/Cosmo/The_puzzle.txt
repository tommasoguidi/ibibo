The puzzle LyricsI felt so defeated
But today i completed
The jigsaw puzzle
After a struggle

How i love you is unfair
Because i have too much forever

Its unfair how i love you
Because you dont want me to
Im not my brother
I love my brother
Do you remember what we did today
It felt evil like a ballet
I finally was completing
The puzzle without cheating

I felt so defeated
But today i completed
The jigsaw puzzle
After a struggleYou might also likeEmbed
