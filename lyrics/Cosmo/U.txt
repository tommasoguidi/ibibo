U LyricsI'm a sucker for you too

I'm looking for clues
As to why I'm alive
And I'm not gonna lose
I will try til I die
The dark is stronger than the love
A stranger leads me from the tub
The hot one with the rain inside
You've written of it in a lie
As for the shit inside me
I can't feel it hardly
The only scars you can see
Are accidents incidentally
Right when I
Lose my high
It's a birthday
We say "time flies"
But its not true
Cause time moves slow
It moves for you
To have time to grow
But growth ends too
Just like a day
At the end of it
All you can do is say
FUCK EM!
FUCK EM!You might also likeEmbed
