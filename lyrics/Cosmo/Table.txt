Table LyricsYou don't have to apologize
For every interaction
If you try to just be kind
You'll find its just a fraction
Of them
That you get wrong

Did you make it home?
Would you let me know
Let me know
You're always a dream
Make me feel like me

Every pencil
That's ever touched paper
Left an imprint on my table
And I can still read every word

I protect my eyes
From it all the time
All the time
And I avert my gaze
From them every day
Every dayYou might also likeEmbed
