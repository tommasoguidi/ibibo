Reading hell chipmunk LyricsWe eat and we sleep and we fuck and we breathe
And we smile at each other and you talk to my brother
And we all laugh, yea we all die
And one of these days one of us is gonna make the other sigh
I hope it’s not me
Nobody wants to see us kiss
It’s pretty disgusting
I know how it is, hannah
I’ll see you in hell
We’ll be doing pretty well cause we’ll be away from this dark
Place where we freak each other out
And maybe you’ll say hi and i’ll look down
Or maybe i’ll say hi and you’ll look the other way through the flames
But at least we’ll be safe from that boy in the sky
I take you outside just to see how it feels
I tell you a lie just to prove that i’m real
I send love letters too soon and then
Oh did i even send it yet?
Goddamn bad haircut boy
But i’ll never have the reaction you want
I don’t care how handsome you are
Something chipmunk, chipped tooth
But i’m just planted here
You’re either really real
Or you’re trying really hard
Well it doesn’t matter either way
Fuck you it’s working!
He’s off to work and i’m off to work
And my thoughtless jerking around makes me sick
And probably you too but i do think real things besides you
I just can't prove it, i just don’t want to
Something chipmunk right now i just want youYou might also likeEmbed
