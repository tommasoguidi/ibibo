I’m glad I don’t need LyricsThe world is a puzzle when everyone loves you
And there's nothing to attend to
And you're scared of bailing cause everyone else has
Failed you

I saw you at the MET
I was outside but
I didn't enter it
We walked down the block

The ultimate fear is worse when its real
Its been so long and now its sad to know
It wasn't like this with anyone else
For you for me differently
A true outsider is when
It's decided for you
When you are just unwelcome
Whether or not you want toYou might also likeEmbed
