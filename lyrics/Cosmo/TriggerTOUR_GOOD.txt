Trigger/TOUR GOOD LyricsWhat is entailed in being human?
Does anyone owe anyone anything?
There's someone I don’t hate who
Just makes me hate you

I get soapy hearted
Remembering your actions I have charted
It all comes down to proof
I'm loathing, I want truth

I start to feel that feeling
It always comes about a week in
I carry equipment
Get Zen with it
I can leave everyone alone
So they can have their fun
I'm a social caterpillar
Everything I say is filler

But it’s OK if no one can surmise
I'm really great inside
I'm really great insideYou might also likeEmbed
