Embody LyricsSome day in bravery
I'll embody all the grace and lightness

Everybody understands me
But I wish nobody understood me
So you could be
The one who did
Embody
All the grace and lightness

The world is pretty big
It's cool we fit on it
It makes me wanna grow
So I can go see more
Sarah is a lightbeam
From the picture Jonah sent me
It makes me so happy
She embodies all the grace and lightness

It's Sunday night and my friends are friends
With my friends
It shows me
They embody all the grace and lightness

Florist signs are everywhere
Emily is in the air
On tour
With Gabby
We'll embody all the grace and lightnessYou might also likeEmbed
