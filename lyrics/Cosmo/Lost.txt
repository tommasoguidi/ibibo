Lost LyricsI am glad you’re happy
Even though it means
I lost you as a friend

And this song is for everyone
I lost because I took myself
So seriously

Cause you could be anyone
It doesn’t matter to me
I'm really glad you’re happy
Even though it means
I lost you as a friend

And this song is for everyone
I lost because I took myself
So seriously

Cause you could be anyone
It doesn’t matter to me

I can’t believe I wanted to
Marry you
Thank god that dream
Wasn’t true

I thought you werе so lucky
But I was wrong
I only found out when you told me

Cause I still call you my bеst friend
Even when we do not spend
Every day together

I know it’s funny but it’s true
Cause girl I'm just not over you
My baby is a flirt
Right where it hurts
You might also likeAnd I'm really glad you’re happy
Even though it means
I lost you as a friend

Cause you could be anyone it
Doesn’t doesn’t matter to meEmbed
