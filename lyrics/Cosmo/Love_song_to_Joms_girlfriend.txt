Love song to Jom’s girlfriend LyricsMy friend Vitti used to always smoke cigarettes out my window
But then one day she sent me a letter saying she moved to France
She still shows up once in a while, she never has a warning but she always has a smile
And an overcoat and she always smokes cigarettes out that window
I say, "Vitti my girl whats the point? While you're here you might as well smoke a joint"
And she says she doesn’t like to change the way her brain works
"Vitti," I say, "It won't be like last time, I promise you won't go out of your mind"
She says it's not worth a try

She tells me about this boy she's staying with in Nice
Who let her give him tattoos on his knees that match hers
They read "Pippi longstocking"
Sometimes Vitti leaves in the middle of the night
Vitti really hate saying goodbyes, but I don't mind
'Cause I've got this boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window
Got this boy nowYou might also likeEmbed
