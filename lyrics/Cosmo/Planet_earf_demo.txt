Planet earf demo LyricsI am not sly
I cannot leave without saying goodbye
Hold my calls
I wanna do nothing at all
I am not you
My feet are too big for ladies shoes
I am just god
I found him deep inside my head

Planet earf
Is a great place
Planet earf
Is a great place
Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earf
Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earf

Planet earf
Is a great place
Planet earf
Is a great place

Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earf

All of my art
Gеts made in a rush
Don’t tune my guitar
And don’t clean my paintbrush
I was so in lovе
That I forgot
How much I hated
Dating

Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earf

Planet earf
Is a great place
Planet earf
Is a great place
Cause he's the handsomest boy on planet earfYou might also likeEmbed
