Trunk of a Tree LyricsYou're the trunk of a tree
Silent, filled with clarity
I am a point in time
Moving slow along a line
You hit just below the note
Oh, to be a fly on the wall of your throat
God, I'd love to climb inside your brain
Remember what it's like to be less vain
I'd close your eyes and see anything
Even just some memoryYou might also like1Embed
