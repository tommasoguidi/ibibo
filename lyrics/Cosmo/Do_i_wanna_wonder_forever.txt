Do i wanna wonder forever LyricsAll you can do is assure me
All you can do is say sorry
A million times or whatever
But do I really wanna wonder forever
Or is it easier to just start over?

How you never quite believe them again
Is the most powerful lack of emotion
Descent of emotion
Is the strongest emotion
Whats the warmest thing we can do
You just walk around and I'll watch you
How you touch the ground so lightly
I feed you a cracker religiously

2 coffees before 4 pm
And I feel like myself again
Yesterday was a vortex
Garlic tour-booking and chess
I pull fuzz off your facе
What's appropriate?

Everything loses and gains valuе
I can't imagine life without you
How you stretched my body out like clay
And made me feel a whole new wayYou might also likeEmbed
