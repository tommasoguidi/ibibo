Actin Weird LyricsMy body's sendin' out some shit
And I cannot keep track of it
I remember feeling like aliens
We were cottonballs dipped in sand
Isn't it weird how we have grown so far apart?
Now I don't know you at all
You're just a name on my GChat bar
Jojo, you were in my dream
Alive and facing away from me
I don't know how to feel
Everybody's actin' weird
Actin' weird
Actin' weird
Actin' weird
