Cow Meeting/Holy Moment LyricsYou fill me with weariness
When you are mysterious

Even though I joke a lot
I still feel the power of God
Justin Bieber made a lot of people christian
People need something to believe in

I go to the cow meeting
The pretzels are steaming
I must have been dreaming
I, Jonathan
I must have been dreaming
Cause when you're heartbroken
It feels like it's just you and him
But now I'm on the other side
And I'm so sorry

My honey's got pointed toes
And a funny heart-shaped nose
The first half of the book is prose
But we just read the poems
And look at the pinecones

Math controls everything
Pinecones and cup rings
Maybe sex too, a kiss
Fibonacci sequence

But I can't remember what it is
