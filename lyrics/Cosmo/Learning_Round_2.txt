Learning (Round 2) LyricsI am a car on a patch of grass
I am a hair on a hairless cat
I am the sky that invented blue
I am a love who isn't you

I see your beauty in other men
We’ll never know just what it meant
I see your beauty in other men
And I try not to dream of them

I feel so bad
I never felt this bad
Tour is scary and it's hard to stay strong
It might help if I could call you on the phone
And hear a friends voice that isnt my own
Being surrounded is like being alone
And there I was on the window sill
Outside your room in pleasantville
With your shirt on as a nightgown
Looking for a way outta that town

And all I have is you
And you are of no use

I learned how to love from you
To carefully follow from the room
Too tired of being strewn along
Bored from being done all wrong
You showed me how to make a sound
You taught me that the earth was round
But that I'm round too, can bounce at any time
I bounced from being yours to being mine

And now I’m strong, now I'm strong
Thanks for doing me so wrongYou might also likeEmbed
