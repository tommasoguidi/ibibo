Heroes LyricsIf i listen to the tape you made
It will make me so afraid
I lose you win
Again
My heroes are my friends

My friends are my heroes
The spirit of joejoe
Is able to live
If i stay positive
But i am so useless
Each day i prove this
The arrow points up and down
I'm just this way around
You

I have too much love
Even for a dog

Seems like my reflection's delayed
When i caught a glimpse of a mirror today
My shadow lags behind my movement
If i run really fast i could lose itYou might also likeEmbed
