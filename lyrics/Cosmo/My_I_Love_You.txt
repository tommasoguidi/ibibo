My I Love You LyricsI do what I have to do
This is when I say my I love you
This is when I say my I love you
I do what I have to do
This is when I say my I love you
This is when I say my I love you

And if I die, tell the world
How he talks to me like I've imagined
How he talks to me like I've imagined
It all
It all
If I drop a pea
You're not here to pick it up for me
In the kitchen I miss him
Jojo Jojo Jojo Jojo Jojo Jo...

I do what I have to do
This is when I say my I love youYou might also likeEmbed
