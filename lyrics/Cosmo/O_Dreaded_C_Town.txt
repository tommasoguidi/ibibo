O Dreaded C Town LyricsIf you really need to stay inside
Just to be sure you don’t break anything
Please don’t invite me over
Cause I don’t think it is working
Today I walked through your town
It’s ruined for me now
I still think you’re in every van
And I peer into all of them
You were a dealer, a friend, a prick, a friend, again
With more to it
Now you’re a ghost, a memory
Or maybe just a bad story
Where are you now
I don’t really care
Who you’re around
Who you’re making scared
I don’t know or care to know
I don’t care or know to careYou might also like1Embed
