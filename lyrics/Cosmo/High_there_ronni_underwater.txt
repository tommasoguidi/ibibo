High there ronni underwater LyricsUnderwater aaron, guess what i am wearing?
Your daddie’s coat, it smells like smoke
Hey ronnie tell me a story
I’m feeling sorry please don’t ignore me
I’m running out of chords, i sound like such a bore
I’m running out of friend, i dreamt that will got famous
Half a mile from your house, i can’t wait to kiss your mouth
Everybody loves a cat, why you gotta be like dat?
What is ronnie? what is ben? who are all these
Handsome men
I was so high and happy you liked arthur russell
Thought about you so hard i pulled a brain muscleYou might also likeEmbed
