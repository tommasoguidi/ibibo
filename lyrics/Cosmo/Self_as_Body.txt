Self as Body LyricsEveryday I break into this place
And I break everything that I face
Am I sick or is life just this lame
Eat and shit, let it all drip and ache

Walk on in and fuck everything up
Should I be allowed near anyone?
And I’m not even sure about this body (not even sure about this body)
Where it lies when I'm not in it (Where it lies when I'm not in it)You might also likeEmbed
