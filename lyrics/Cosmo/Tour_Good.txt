Tour Good LyricsI don’t know what I’m cut out for
If there’s anything I have love for
I throw myself upon its door
And tell it how fucked you are
Up in morning
Down at dawn
Warm up vocals
Sing a song
Sit in car
Read a book
Rest stop eggs or chips
I look at you every day
You change, I change, hoorayYou might also likeEmbed
