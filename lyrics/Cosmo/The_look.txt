The look LyricsYou look at me like you hate me
You look at me like you love me
Why puzzle over it?
I gotta make this
Song

'Cause when I look down
I look up and you're gone
Seems I'm always around

You look at me like you love me
You look at me like you hate me
Why puzzle over it?
I gotta make this
