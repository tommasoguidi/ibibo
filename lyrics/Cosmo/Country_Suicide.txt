Country Suicide Lyrics[Intro]
Life sure had its moments, but now it's time to move on
And don't think of it as dying, think of it as graduation
'Cause after a certain age, you hope for a living wage, that's all
And living without passion like I am is hardly living at all


[Chorus]
So what's the difference if I go now, or in 2020
When I look back at the last twelve years
I don't see any reason to stay here

[Verse 1]
But before I go I'm gonna do some things
And I don't mean like catching up on my reading
'Cause when you know you're about to die you can get away with anything
There's so much you can do when you're not worried about losing
Like insult people a lot more or take things from the corner store
Or pee in my hallway, mostly being a jerk is what I have planned for my last days
So maybe you won't mind as much when I go 'cause I'll be such
A bastard that you won't miss me and then my plan will have worked perfectly

[Chorus]
So, what's the difference if I go now or in 2020
When I look back at the last 12 years
I can't see any reason to stay here

[Verse 2]
And yes there has been some good times
But most of them weren't even mine
And yes, I'm enjoyed some things
But a lot of them were on television

[Chorus]
So what's the difference if I go now, or in 2020
Or maybe 2010
'Cause who knows what the world will be like
I think I know; it'll be the same
But a little worse just like every day
And no, I don't think
I'm gonna miss anything but drinking
So what's the difference if I go now or in 2020
When I look back at the last twelve years
I can't find any reason to stay hereYou might also likeEmbed
