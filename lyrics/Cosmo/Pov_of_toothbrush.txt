Pov of toothbrush LyricsI wonder why
The guy who’s always standing next to her mouth
Is putting me in his now
He put me into his mouth
And now frankie yells
And puts me in a dark pink case
In the cabinet far away from everyone else
I only see the light twice a day now
And then i go straight into her mouth
And back into the cabinet
I wonder why
The guy who’s always standing next to her mouth
Put me into his mouthYou might also likeEmbed
