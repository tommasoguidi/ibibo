Worst girl LyricsI'm the worst girl ever
I'm the worst girl ever
'cause when I feel in love with you
I know it’s just nostalgia
When i feel in love with you
I know it’s just nostalgia
For the way it was with you
Before we found out
All the stuff about
My body
I'm the worst girl ever
And you don’t make me feel much better
When i feel in love with you
I know it’s just nostalgia
For the way it was with you
Before we found out
All the stuff about
My brain
My brain


I'm the worst girl ever
And you don’t make me feel much betterYou might also likeEmbed
