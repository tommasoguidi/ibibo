Knocking wrists LyricsYou don’t need to look outside to know that its dusk
I don’t need to look at the clock to know its time to fuck
So put your hips on my mine
Knocking wrists is fine
I get glitter in my eyes
I got pink upon my thighs
And i got minor chords outta me
And i got so drunk i forgot how to see
And i was loved by a boy named william
Every night i have dreams that i kill him
And i’ve been so drunk i couldn’t move
And i forgot how to love
& i’ve been naked in ben’s kitchen
And i don’t tell him i miss him
Cause now i think i like aaron
But he probably doesn’t like me back
But it probably doesn’t matter
Cause your dad’s up on some ladder
And my dad’s just an actorYou might also likeEmbed
