Leaf Doctor LyricsSex is cool but have you heard of:
If I hadn't discovered it
I could have been
A leaf doctor?

I’ve got eyes for days but I just
Waste ‘em on darting around
And the only thing that I've found
Is I'd rather be at home

I busted some capillaries over you
I even lost a friend or two
Oh, Lexie
You don’t even know the best me
Oh, Lexie
I wanna give you the best me
[instrumental break]

I busted some capillaries over you
I even lost a friend or two
Oh, Lexie
You don't even know the best me
Oh, Lexie
I wanna give you the best meYou might also likeEmbed
