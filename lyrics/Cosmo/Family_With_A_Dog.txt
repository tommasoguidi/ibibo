Family With A Dog LyricsI just want a family with a dog and a boyfriend filled with love
One night you must have followed me
Into the bathroom at a christmas party
And all the nude i had ever been disintegrated
And i can still see the beauty in evil
But i see a lot more evil these days
And i seem a lot more evil too
I can feel it in our evil waysYou might also likeEmbed
