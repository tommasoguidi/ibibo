School LyricsArt school makes you wild
Real school makes you wanna get high
High school makes you crazy
High school made me cry

I am shy to begin with
This is the diagnosis
I can't focus
And i can't keep up cause im always running away

All your friends are drunk and wild
All my friends are depressed
My daddy is a fireman
And yours is an actress
I won't go
I won't go
I won't go
I won't go
I won't go
I won't go
I won't go
I won't goYou might also likeEmbed
