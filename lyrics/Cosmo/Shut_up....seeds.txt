Shut up....seeds LyricsAll that poetry is mine
I heard you like it through the grape vine
Fine by me

I named Ronnie, Ronnie
And it’s a new decade
So why do you care so much

I’m a girl with the velvet touch
And I finally talked to god
So I’m not afraid of murder now
Soon
My honey’s gonna love me
Soon
My honey’s gonna touch me

This life is small
And I got no intentions
Soon

Someday I’ll tell my daughter Eliza
Just try to make the same mistakes that I’ve done
They're pretty fun

But when the fun is ovеr
You'll get hungover
That’ why the moon is not a quartеr
It's probably a dime

If you cut the seed in half
And then you cut that in half
Then you cut it in half
And then you have that

It’s nothing
That’s the thing
That we are made of
You might also likeI have black dots on my teeth
If you cut them in half
And you cut that in half
Cut it in half and you have
Nothing
That’s the thing
That I’m made of

I just want to be found if I die
Cut that in half
And if I cut it in half
Then I have that
It’s nothingEmbed
