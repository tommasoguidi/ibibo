Spagetti LyricsTell me where you are
And i will go there
I don’t wanna die
I don’t really care
Let’s make spaghetti
And we can eat it
I think i love you
Not that you need it
Think about you
How’s it going?
Feel so lonely
Write a poem
I swallowed a spider
Not much of a fighter
I’m small and you’re larger
