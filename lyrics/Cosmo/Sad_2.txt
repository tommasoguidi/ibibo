Sad 2 LyricsHe was just a dog
Now his body's gone
So what is left
But me and my poem?

I am just a normal girl
But my name is Frank
I just wanna get taken
On a date

All the crazies on the bus
Love me so much
I laugh at all the lights
And feel a little right
What is coffee
And what is wine?
I don't mind
If you don't mind

Honey you're always so sad
Cat's out of the bag
I'm sad too
Dad made the appointment
To kill my best friend
There goes my fear of death

I just want my dog back
Is that so much to ask?
I wish that
I could kiss his pawsYou might also likeEmbed
