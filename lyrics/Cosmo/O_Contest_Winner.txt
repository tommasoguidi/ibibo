O Contest Winner LyricsLeo, leo, leo, leo, leo, Leonie
Joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, Joana
I don't, I don't, I don't wanna go to the party
Without, without you, without you begging me
O Contest Winner, my veil is growing thinner

I'd rather be a bird and kiss dogs
Than have your word engraved on a log

Cause I'm no nuisance
I'm void and truant
No need for a re-test
I know I'm a genius
Leonie is my sister
And I miss her
Joana is my sister
And I miss herYou might also likeEmbed
