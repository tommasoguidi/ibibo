Grief LyricsJoejoe
You go
I've never lost something before
And I can't stop clinging
I just want my dog back
Is that too much to ask?
And I just keep thinking
Everything smells like water
Swallowed by the earth's disorder
My brother's angry grief busts my lip
And my dog's bad hipYou might also likeEmbed
