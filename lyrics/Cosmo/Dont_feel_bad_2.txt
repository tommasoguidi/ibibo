Dont feel bad 2 LyricsWell I can’t take you off of my speed dial
And you can’t take me off of your mind

Well Greta doesn’t like it but I don’t wanna be “whipped”
And I can’t take your name off of my hip

And that is why I call you anyway
And tell her you’re not going anywhere

I got a girl with brown hair
And I can’t get her off of me
And she gets sooooo jealous
But I don’t know what to do but go about it
Can’t get you off of my mind
Can’t get you outta my head
I don’t wanna have to die
I just wanna be dead

Everyone’s bored cause they don’t know what to do
I wanna have a secret romance with you
