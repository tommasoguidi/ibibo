Da Santiclaus Fe LyricsHe said to me how about that weather?
I know I’ll love you forever
Waste management, someone come take me away
Waaaaste maaanagement someone come take me away
You’re a girl-watcher here comes one now
Adobe photoshop dreams, I don’t know how
It’d be so nice to be a bird
You hurt my head with your wacky words
Maybe I’d like to be Walt Whitman, write the same song again and again
I brought your sweatshirt to New Mexico
We’re just friends who hold hands and kiss and remember things
I’m still living in a paper doll world
I hate that you were in my bed I’d rather have anywhere else to remember instead
I wanna be close to you but I don’t wanna step on your toes
Oh let me know how it goes
In April of 2010 I made you think that you were young again
We talked from 12 to 4 am but we were hesitant
We’re not all complex we all just want sex
How could I know where did you go
New York Pretty at it’s citiest but you make me feel so hideous
When I first saw you, you had a harmonica ‘round your neck
No one’s ever alone but me what the heck
Motherfuck it feels so good I didn’t know I fucking could I wanna bike around your hood on my fucking bikeYou might also likeEmbed
