Time sux LyricsI don’t care what you do
As long as you do it to me
Cause I’m in love with you
Jewelry lasts forever
So does a love letter
But sometimes that seems wrong
So maybe I’ll write you a 3 minute song
Or maybe we’ll eat a 30 second donut
Or maybe you’ll make me laugh for a moment
But it doesn’t really matter how much time
Goes by
Cause nothing really matters since Zennie died
It’s all I can do to keep the Zen alive
When I’ve got you on my mind
I don’t think about timeYou might also likeEmbed
