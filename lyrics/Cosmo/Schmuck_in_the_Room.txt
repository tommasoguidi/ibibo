Schmuck in the Room LyricsLife is long as fuck
And I just wanna stay sharp
How many ways can u call
Whatever i do small
The weird sound guy
Would never touch a man that way

I'd rather be in the bathroom
With a national geographic
Than talk to anyone
Haven't you heard
If you can't pinpoint the schmuck in the room
It's you, it's you, it's you
"It's all for you"

A kid with a pineapple head
Has some kind of hold on my friend
And I dont understand
All I see is phony

"No shoulder" is what the road sign says
I remember how it felt when I was
Without one
