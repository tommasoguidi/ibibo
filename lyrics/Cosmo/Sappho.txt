[Verse 1]
From the street I see your window
And I look up in
Is that even your house?
Is that Sappho you're readin'?

[Chorus]
Is it cool when I don't care?
Can you feel me in the air?
Under the crack in the door
Can you tell I have no floor?
And I'm shiverin' just thinkin'
Where have you been all these minutes?
[Verse 2]
I am too stressed out to
Do the thing that they won't do
But why should I fight back?
I'm just not like that
And I'm sorry if
I have been a real bad friend
Your face too close to mine
To hear you talk

[Verse 3]
So I look up into your window
From the street where I am standing (So I look up into your window)
Is that even your house? (From the street where I'm standing)
Is that your landing? (Is that even your house?)
And I wanna know what (Is that your landing?)
You're readin'

[Chorus]
Is it cool when I don't care?
Can you feel me in the air?
Under the crack in the door
Can you tell I have no floor?
I'm not grounded, nothin'
Nothin', nothin'
