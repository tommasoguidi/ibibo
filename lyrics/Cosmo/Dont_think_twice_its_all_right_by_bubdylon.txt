Don’t think twice it’s all right by bubdylon LyricsWell it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Iffin you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do some how

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never did before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, girl
I can't hear you any more

I'm thinkin' and a-wondering walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, gal
So I just say fare thee well

I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all rightYou might also likeEmbed
