Drinks LyricsIf you wanna survive the night
You’ll need a lot of purple wine
Cause you’ll be here all alone with me
And you really don’t wanna be

If you wanna get through the year
You’ll need a billion bubbling beers
And I’ll watch you gulp down the yellow
And you’ll look down and not say hello

If you have to spend the day with me
Make sure you bring some good whiskey
In case I have a lot to say
I’ll talk and talk the whole brown day
And now it’s time to sleep together
We haven’t done that in forever
It makes everything else betterYou might also likeEmbed
