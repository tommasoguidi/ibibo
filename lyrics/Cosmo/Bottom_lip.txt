Bottom lip LyricsSoft bottom lip ronnie
You are the story
If you are the morning
I am fifth avenue and i am trafficky

I am losing my memory
French kissing is so friendly
If i love you and you hate me
I'll just kiss you when you let me

Talk to me
I'll tell you a gooey
Never ending story
Of ronnie and frankie
Soft bottom lip ronnie
You are the story
If you are the morning
I am fifth avenue and i am traffickyYou might also likeEmbed
