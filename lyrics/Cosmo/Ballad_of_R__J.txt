Ballad of R & J LyricsI’ll give it back if you want it
All that time you wasted on it
I dreamed of you in the car
I wanna know how you are

From August to October
It felt like it was over
Don’t wear yourself out me
Don’t lie down about me

Ricky felt alone now
So he went to the store
Gathered up some flowers
To mail to Julie’s door
The field so watery and wide
Passes me on either side
Didn’t talk to you today
Doesn’t matter either way

You know I like 'em cut
With a certain I-don’t-know-what
Dipped into the reserve
Bathed in the dirt I deserve

Julie had his flowers
Taped up on the wall
"It's better to love Ricky
From afar than not at all"You might also likeEmbed
