Knives in my throat LyricsMe in my famous red raincoat
Staring as you look like a sailboat

I gulp down knives in my throat
You called me “mom” and it hurt

I am boring
I am lame
But sometimes
I can go insane
You are cocaine, bleach blonde, insane
I am nothing I am nothing
You are cocaine, bleach blonde, insane
I am nothing I am nothing

I am “wash it before you wear it”
I faked you out a little bit
You are cocaine, bleach blonde
You tricked me with a song

I wanna know what your song is about
Before I put my lips on your mouth

You are cocaine, bleach blonde, insane
I am nothing I am nothing
You are cocaine, bleach blonde, insane
I am nothing I am nothing

Dating is dumb, giving up your life to someone
Giving up is dumb too, so you better push through
The trees are thin, the grass is patchy
And he is him, and I am happyYou might also likeEmbed
