You Are LyricsI write a book for you
I wonder if
I write a book for you
I wonder if I do

I must apologize to your guitar
I would to you if I knew where you are
And if I knew where you are
It would be you where you are
It would be where you are
I would be where you are
I write a book for you
I wonder if I do
I write a book for you
I wonder if I do?You might also likeEmbed
