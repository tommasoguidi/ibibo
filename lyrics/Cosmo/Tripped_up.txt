Tripped up LyricsI get all tripped up
Thinking that i am clear
You are an angel
Seashell for an ear
I am a traveler
Circling the world
You are a journal
With a million words

I love darwin
I love aran
My love isnt
My love
I write a million books for you
I write a thousand songs for you
I write a book i write a book now
Hot coffee makes me tired
Your love is a liar
Jonah in a purple sweater
Boston is perfect weatherYou might also likeEmbed
