Field Day LyricsField day got rained out
So we all sat around
And talked about
Television

I'm in love with a bowling ball
Cry alone in the mammal hall
I wanna live on a farm with you
And maybe we'll flirt but we'd never cheat on each other

You yawn at me
Like my therapist
In therapy I talk about
Everybody I've ever kissed
Everybody's yawning
Every single morning
When they wake up next to
People who are boring

Field day got rained out
So we all sat around
And thought about
Television

You think you are happy
Because you aren't looking at me
I think you'll be fine
If you just get me off your mindYou might also likeEmbed
