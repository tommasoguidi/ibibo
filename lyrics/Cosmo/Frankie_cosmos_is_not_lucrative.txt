Frankie cosmos is not lucrative LyricsYou say the stars are made of velvet
I say is it really?
I say the stars are made of velvet
You really had me

I am the princess and you are the pea
That’s why you sleep under me
We sleepwalk into the fog
You are the dolly and I am the dog

Say it to my face
Otherwise
I'll never realize
Frankie Cosmos is not lucrative
Greta go back to school

You are being selfish
If you do not tell me

Frankie Cosmos is not lucrative
Greta go back to school

If you tell me
I'll just think you’re mean
And I'll keep doing it anyway

Frankie Cosmos is my name
I forget my gameYou might also likeEmbed
