Birthday Song LyricsJust because I am a certain age
Doesn't mean that I am any older
Than I was yesterday

Cause I get all flushed and ugly
Wonder how ever he loved me
I am so clumsy

I think how repulsive to you
It must be when I refuse
To do the things you want me to
I hate everybody in this town
So I walk around with my head down
And sit alone

Sometimes I just want you Joe Joe
But I know that that is no no
It's so impossibleYou might also like1Embed
