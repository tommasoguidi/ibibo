[Verse 1]
I'm just trying to know
What I wanna die surrounded by
Of all the books I'm halfway through
I could build a staircase up to you

[Chorus]
Half a memory is tugging at me
Abigail, I want you to be alive with me

[Verse 2]
Can't believe who I used to be
What did I see in you or you in me?
It's good sometimes to cut her slack
That version of myself I don't want back
[Chorus]
If I die right now, I need you to see
Abigail, I want you to be alive with me
Abigail, I want you to be alive with me
