Boogie LyricsI went to the store
My life is a bore
Then I went home
Then I got stoned

I don't go to school
I know I'm not cool
I am very rude
I ate all the food
And I am very bored
So I go to the store
Cause you're the one I like to boogie with oh yeah
Cause you're the one I like to boogie with

When your eyes are open
They seem to be closed
You are so beautiful
And no one knows

When you are happy
You seem to be sad
You are so vulnerable
So you get treated bad

But you're the one I like to boogie with oh yeah
Cause you're the one I like to boogie with
You're the one I like to boogie with oh yeah
Cause you're the one I like to boogie withYou might also likeEmbed
