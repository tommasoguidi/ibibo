Birth Control Lament LyricsIf I'm sad, could you take my hand?
No way you could understand
Birth control you fucked me up
I wish that I could throw you up
Take my hand in dream land

No one gives a shit these days
Everybody's in a haze
I don't wanna get high
You dont like you but I don't mind
Everybody's feeling lame
At Eliza's drinking beers
Makes me feel really weird
Hotboxing the shower stall
I don't feel so good at all
Everybody's acting weird

I went to your house one night
Drank enough to feel alright
I just wanna kiss your neck
Now it's getting hard again
I can't stand you're so polite

(Outro)
Oooh ooh oooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oooohYou might also likeEmbed
