I look at me I am happy LyricsWhen you dont want me I look at my body
It's awkward and dirty I feel unsturdy
When you dont hold my hand I totally understand
You just can't walk with ease, I pull it in my sleeve
And when you don't love me I look above me
And I talk to my god even though he's a dog

And I ask him if I'll be ok
And he says that he was once a stray
And that was when we took him home
And loved him and made him our own
And you have done the same to me
Which doesn't mean that I'm not free
I dont know what else it means
As long as I don't become we
I can stay me
I am happy
I look at me
I am happy
I am just me
I am happy
