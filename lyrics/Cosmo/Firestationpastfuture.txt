[spoken intro]
My name is frankie cosmos and I live next to a fire station

[song]
You are so obsessed with the past
And I am so obsessed with the future
You are so obsessed with yourself
And I am so obsessed with you too
You are so surrounded by the past
And I am so fixated on the future
You are so surrounded by yourself
And I am so surrounded by you
But you know I want to
