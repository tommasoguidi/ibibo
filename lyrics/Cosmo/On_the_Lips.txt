On the Lips LyricsI watch David Blaine
Find myself believing
In anything, in many things
I watch David Blaine
Find myself believing
In anything, in anything

Where would I kiss ya
If I could kiss ya?
Why would I kiss ya
If I could kiss ya?
I'm sorry I'm high, let's go
Sometimes I cry 'cause I know
I'll never have all the answers
Separated by a subway transfer
I watch you disappear
As my train rolls away
I know you could've kissed me
But I'll have to wait

Where would I kiss ya
If I could kiss ya?
Why should I kiss ya
If I could kiss ya?You might also like1Embed
