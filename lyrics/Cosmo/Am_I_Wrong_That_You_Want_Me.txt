Am I Wrong That You Want Me LyricsAm I wrong that you want me
The questions that haunt me
Affirms glinting
The love I was hinting

Everywhere I look is sadness
All I seem to feel is badness
Everywhere I look is sadness
Always seems like you're the baddest

Look what you do to me
Everybody can see
And it shows on my face
In a well lit place
Everywhere I look is sadness
Always seems like youâ€™re the baddest
Everywhere I look is sadness
All I seem to feel is badness

Am I wrong that you want me?
The questions that haunt me
Affirms glinting
The love I was hintingYou might also likeEmbed
