Am i trying im not trying LyricsAm I trying?
I'm not trying
To make it
If you make it
And you're famous
Will you tell David Letterman about me?
If you make it
Will you tell domino records about me?

Am i trying?
Im not trying
To make it
I would like to but im not trying
To make it
Because i was told when i was younger
That i looked stupid in a dress
And i felt like i
Could never try
Without failing

Am i trying
Im not tryingYou might also likeEmbed
