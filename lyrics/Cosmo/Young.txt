Young LyricsWith this I'm scrapin' by
At least it's cute that I tried
I wrote some songs that I sung
And have you heard I am so young?
And who my parents are?
I heard about being young
But I'm not sure how it's done
Thought I heard a mumble
Something about "fun"
Fun
Fun
"Easy for you to say," I say
I say this to you every day
Easy for you to say
The sky is a special orange streak
Between balloons, two moons
A leak of light in a blue town like this
The clouds are you, the sky a kiss
That never shows or comes oh what
A waste sits in the parking lot
I just wanna be alive, that's it

Alive
