The blues come back LyricsAnd some days they come back
And some days they come back

And i’ve been trout fishing in the east
And i’ve been trout fishing in the west
And i’ve been trout fishing all over this town
And i’ve been trout wishing you were around

And some days they come back
Some days they come back
And you left The Great Gatsby at my house
You left The Great Gatsby at my house
And some days they come back
And some days they come back

And you left your baseball cap
And you left your baseball hat
And some days they come backYou might also likeEmbed
