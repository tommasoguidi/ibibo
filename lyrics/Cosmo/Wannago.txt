Wannago LyricsThe cloud so big and dark
Foams up around my heart
The pointed arms of trees
Saying "this is where the cloud is"

Road wet with yellow lines
And shadows of cars & planes
It's been forever, but it’s whatever
I'm here for you and I would never
Forget you
Forget you
You are the best
But your will is less strong than the rest
So you just rest
We go together like cymbal and snare
Held back and thrust together again

It's miraculous that humans are here
We built ourselves or god is real
And we ended up with eyes and ears
And dreams and science and love and fears

I’m crying here
In the backseat
Our home is far
Away, empty
And you love me
And you love me
And love is a miracle
Cause life's a dream

Prada red and Matisse blue
Far yet, close together like me and you

I'm almost there (I'm almost there)
I'm almost there (I wanna go back)
I wanna go back (I'm almost there)
I want to go back (I wanna go back)
Where can you put yourself that makes sense (I'm almost there)
I'm worried that i might forget (I wanna go back)
I’m almost there (I’m almost there)
I'm almost there (I wanna go back)
I wanna go back (I’m almost there)
I want to go back (I wanna go back)

I'd listen to your voice
All day while I'm gone
Telescope straight to your songEmbed
