Dancing LyricsDancing like the answer to a question that I do not know the answer to
But maybe you dance like the answer to an ever-changing question

Orange sports car or religion
I put $40 on pump 6 and I drive
If you saw me you would probably die

Dancing like the answer to an ever-changing question
Whatever or nothing

I cry more times a day than you did in 5 years
Youâ€™ve bought more pairs of jeans than you ever shed tearsYou might also likeEmbed
