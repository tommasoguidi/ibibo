Owen LyricsI love my brother Owen
Though I do not know him
I only dream of you
Sometimes Eliza too

It's raining in my head
I cry and eat my bread
My tears are what I spread
On convoluted meals

Icicles hanging in caves
Have very special names
I love my honey's lungs
I kiss him on the tongue
Ronnie and Frank
Holding hands at the bank
I'm doing what I've done
We're not having much funYou might also likeEmbed
