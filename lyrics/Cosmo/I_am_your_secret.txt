I am your secret Lyrics97th street park bench
My sweatshirt was all wet
And that thing with my leg
When I laid inside my bed

I am your secret
No one would believe it
So I will stay a secret
I thought it was wonderful

Stealing drinks from home depot
You say you love me and miss me
But disappear after you kiss me
At my weakest I am sleepless
My weakness is your secret
I am your secret
I was your secret
And I will remain a secretYou might also likeEmbed
