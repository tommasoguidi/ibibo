Set your parents house on fire LyricsYou're a bum
You're no fun
I don't care
What you wear
It's about
How you feel
You don't feel
You're not real
You just steal
People's hearts
And you tear them apart
So now we're not friends
But i can pretend
That i feel fine
Yeah i don't mind
Ah ah ahh
Set your parents house on fire
Set your parents house on fire
Set your parents house on fire
I'll set your parents house on fire

The only time i ever see you is in my dreams
Got something to tell you gonna make you scream
You might of strung me along
But i still like hearing your songs
But they aren't still about me
I'll watch you play i just need whiskey
All the girls wanna kiss you
I dreamt you told me 'i miss you'
I was so fucked up i was lying in the street
When i called you i thought you were being mean
I know it takes a lot to be nice to me
Wouldn't wanna you to waste all your energy

Ah ah ahhh
Set your parents house on fire
Set your parents house on fire
Set your parents house on fire
I'll set your parents house on fireYou might also likeEmbed
