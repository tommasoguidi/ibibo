Sand Lyrics[Verse]
I wanna kiss your stupid thumb
Cause I love when the days are long
I notice more of everything
Might even try to be a friend
You hold my hair right by the end
And we hold hands around the bend
Touch all the books outside The Strand
The oldest pages soft like sand
The oldest pages soft like sandYou might also likeEmbed
