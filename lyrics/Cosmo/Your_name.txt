Your name LyricsYour name is so great
I make the mistake
Of making it known
So others can moan

Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie

I feel like a herb
When i'm not invited
I wanna hang out
But it's not requited
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh

I know what she said
I saw the text
Don't know what you said back
What the heck

Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie oh oh oh ronnie
Oh ronnie ohYou might also likeEmbed
