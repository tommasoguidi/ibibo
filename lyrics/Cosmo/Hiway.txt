Hiway LyricsHighway
I drive along the spine
And I pull over
At the shoulder
And flash my headlights in his eyes

He is a highway
I drive along the spine
And I pull over
At the shoulder
And flash my headlights in his eyes
He is a highway
I drive along the spine
And I pull over
At the shoulder
And flash my headlights in his eyesYou might also likeEmbed
