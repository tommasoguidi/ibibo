Lady Forest LyricsQuiet birds
Nightmares
Sometimes you’re so quiet
I forget you’re there
And I guess it’s pretty nice
That our toothbrushes were
Kissin' this morning

In my Neil Young slumber
I feel so much younger
Than you
Note the smog above my home
Kiss my dog when I’m alone
You spit upon
The holy one

And I am
A bowling ball
Throwing up
In the hall, ah
Please hear my desperate plea
Do not‚ do not
Ruin me

Lady forest in the dirt
Ghosts hot glued onto her shirt
But I can close my shadow
Another way
By shutting my eyes
The shadow disappearsYou might also likeEmbed
