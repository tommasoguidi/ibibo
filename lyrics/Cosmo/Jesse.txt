Jesse LyricsMe and Jesse stayed up ’til two
We talked about dreams, about things, about you
It felt like anything could be real or fake
Like our love is my world, but so is my heartache

And I knew
If I thought really hard about flying
I could probably do it
I’m just too tired for trying

I created a scorpion
And then had to kill it
Just like I loved you
And I had to will it
To end
‘Cause I bent the rules and I’m scary
My dream
Is to see the world that I’m wearing

I’ll have to break our deepest hopes
They keep you in shape
Too late to explain
How many things of whole and good

The mirror
Glittered all blue and silver
But I was never
In it to begin with

I like to be a shadow
In a shadow
More deep when visible
Than invisible

Oh to be part of the scenery
Oh to be filled with apathy
For you to be a little bit scared of meYou might also likeEmbed
