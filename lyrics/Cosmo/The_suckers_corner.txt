The suckers corner Lyricsall of the suckers are standing in one corner
and i'm right there with them it's not that we're loners
we all stand together cause in the world
there's suckers and there's jerks
and temptation doesn't strike the sucker
we all just get fucked over
fuck it
suckers should be proud
we're the only good people around
cause temptation doesn't strike the sucker
we all just get fucked overEmbed
