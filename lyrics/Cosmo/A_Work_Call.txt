A Work Call LyricsPower down
I'm pink like a candy heart from
Trying to keep up

Running towards, running to
Running after you

Not quite sure what I
Am looking for
There are guides out here
They're knocking at my door
You take a work call
I close my eyes
And feel the wind
On my lids
It's not too late
To say goodbye

Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again

Again
And again
And again, again

And again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again and again and again, again
Again
