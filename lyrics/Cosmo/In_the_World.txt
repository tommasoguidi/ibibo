In the World LyricsLove is crazy and I didn't know
How much it made me lose my mind for you
Do you wish me well?
I don’t know if I do
But I have figured out
Myself by getting away from you
I'm sitting down in the world again
It's all good and I don’t know anything
A day goes by that I don't think of you
I'm sitting down in the world again
It's all good and I don't know anythingYou might also likeEmbed
