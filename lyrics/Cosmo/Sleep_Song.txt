Sleep Song LyricsNow that i know that every time i get sad you just hate me
You can go to sleep and sleep it off peacefully
I’ll be here all night feeling totally fucked
Wondering what tomorrow will be like and staying up
I guess i just make myself the victim like you said
That’s why when you treat me shitty YOU get mad
It all makes sense now, thanks so much
Goodbye forever what the fuckYou might also likeEmbed
