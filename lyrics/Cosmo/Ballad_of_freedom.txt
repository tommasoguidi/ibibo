Ballad of freedom LyricsThere goes
Frankie Cosmos
And her travel journal

Who knows
Frankie Cosmos
But her travel journal?

Being free
Doesnt make you happy
She feels in between
Feeling and nothing
She goes alone
Along the street
He's at home
Very fast asleep

Being free
Doesnt make you happy
She feels very in between
Feeling and nothing

There goes
Frankie Cosmos
And her travel journalYou might also likeEmbed
