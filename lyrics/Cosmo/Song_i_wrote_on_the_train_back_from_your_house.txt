Song i wrote on the train back from your house LyricsMy heart is broken I don’t know what to do
I don’t have a clue, no I don’t have a clue
My heart is broken, it's got me feeling blue
My heart ain’t working cause its in love with you
My heart's so sad now its got me feeling angry
My heart's been crying cause its just baby
My heart is broken its got me feeling blue
My heart ain’t working cause its in love with you
It's in love with youYou might also likeEmbed
