Iâ€™m It LyricsI'm following it even though it is not what I expected
I don't know if it's me or I'm it, but I cannot regret it
When it's all over, I don't
When it's all over, I don't know what
When it's all over, I don't know what happened to me

The air hangs in the air
I don't care if you don't care
I care that I care
When it's all over, I don't
When it's all over, I don't know what
When it's all over, I don't know what happened to meYou might also likeEmbed
