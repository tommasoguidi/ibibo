Caramelize LyricsCaramelize
You make me blue
I wanna make a man out of you

The light in the world is dull
It’s hard

Like empty space through the darkness
Close my eyes and they start to sting
Feeling my tear ducts doing their thing
I’m kinda pretty, that’s why you want it so bad

When the heart gets too tender
Return it to the sender
Be more centered
If you miss your friend
Call them again
Last night I got so swept up
My heart beat was kept up
That song you gave to me
Is it wrong or meant to be?

When you rolled off way back when
I got this feeling I would never see you again
But here you are in my bed
Heart gets tender

Those gaping wide
Secret eyes
Closed on me
They don’t wanna see

I want in on the other side
Love your eyelids where you hide
Or further in that neatest dark
You might also likeBut my boyish emotion
Keeps me soft like the ocean
Are you relieved when I leave?

That I needed to be held
Is a vice like anything else
Let the others push you down
Other vices to make you mad

I just want to give you strength
Help you make all you can make
The extent to which you’ve grown on me
I can feel now you’ve got a hold on me

When you rolled off way back when
I got this feeling I would never see you again
But here you are in my bed
Heart gets tenderEmbed
