F.O.O.F. Lyrics[Verse 1]
Counting down the days of the week
Ever since I decided to freak out on Friday

[Chorus]
What a sight to see
Before 1 p.m. me
Listening to 2007 indie, exercising

[Verse 2]
It's still Wednesday, I have to wait
Two more sleeps 'til I can freak out on Friday
[Bridge]
Counting sheep 'til my turn to speak
I'm super bummed I have to go
I guess I'll see you after, though
When I freak out on Friday

[Chorus]
What a sight to see
Before 1 a.m. me
Listening to 2019 FrankieYou might also likeEmbed
