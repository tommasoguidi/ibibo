Wound up LyricsI love you but i’m still haunted by wounds from other boys
Still freckled by things far back and near
Some are still nearly gaping
But not with love, just with having been undone
And never explained
All the love of you in the cosmos couldn’t close me up
So don’t even try
Just de-robe with me and widen my eyesYou might also likeEmbed
