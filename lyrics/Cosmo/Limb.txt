Limb LyricsYou’re the one who knows
My favorite place
You can feel what’s on my face

I like what I see
In the mirror, it’s me
You like it too
You can feel the truth

I’ll see you in two weeks
I’ll kiss your pink cheeks
At a museum or library
We could get so solitary
In the beauty
Do you like to be
So alone with me?

Winter's gonna be long
I can feel it as I write this one
We could be so warm
If you would just come home

It’s a lie that if
You stay in
You can’t still go out
On a limbYou might also likeEmbed
