Fruit Stand LyricsBy the time I wake up
You'll be long gone
Like a fruit stand in the evening

I pass on the left
Everybody's left
If it's raining and I can't feel it, is it raining?

Love is a translucent sheet
Hovering above concrete
Both reflective and clear
Beautiful with anything it's near
When it shatters
Nothing matters
There's all these pieces
But apart, they have no meaning
If it's raining and I can't feel it, is it raining?You might also likeEmbed
