Eternal LyricsNothing is ever nothing
Everything is everything
Inside of part of everything is nothing
I was handed pure belief just to be candid
I saw that I never ended
Whatever
Is inside of whatever
It was never an issue
I miss you
If you can let it make you laugh
It's steam that’s trapped
Unravel
All the windows are so scary
Everyone you meet is married
They're made of infinite love
I'm made of it too
That’s why I'm stronger than you
I walk through an ocean
Just to see if light was closing
The windows
On smartness
Up to my ear in darkness
In a ball of night
It feels I gave you all the light
But it's not over
Just cause its over as I knew it
Doesn't mean I blew it
I'm not angry and I'll prove it
I'm not angry
The discussion is just lengthy
I'll show it
Just as soon as I can know it
Eternal
I see it
Even when I am between itYou might also likeEmbed
