So Blue LyricsI am everyone you'll never meet
I am every book you'll never read
I am the picture that didn't come out
I am the story stuck inside of your mouth

The sky is so blue, it makes everything else blue
The trucks, the stones, the view
I am so blue, I make everyone else blue
My friends, my enemies, you

I am so blue, I make everyone else blue
My friends, my enemies, youYou might also likeEmbed
