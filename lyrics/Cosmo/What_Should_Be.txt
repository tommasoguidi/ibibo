What Should Be LyricsI was the car I drove us there
You were around cause you were the air
I was the brains you were the braun
I knew you'd hurt me all along

Who's gonna kiss me at the show?
I hope it's you but I don't know

The word love makes me so hot (What should be?)
The word fuck makes me so not (What should be?)
2 cheese slices and a soda
4.99 at the corner
Makes me think of only you
Even when I don't want to

What should be?
What should be?

Aw hey Bambino
Thought I knew but I don't know
