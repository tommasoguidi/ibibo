NYC is cold LyricsI did something bad
I don't wanna talk about it

New York City is cold
To me
And the trains are fast
Asleep
I like the way you
Marry me
I saw you on the
TV
At the diner
I ordered
The usual
The usual
The usual

Got a crush In the brain the brain
Sinks down the drain
But I’m happy plain
Old loving you
Don’t want nothing new

I did something bad
I don’t wanna talk about it

You are sooo handsome
You held me for ransomYou might also likeEmbed
