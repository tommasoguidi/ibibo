Wreck tangled LyricsYou type your poems, breathing
I’m up here reading, seething
I hope this is right & okay
I hope you don’t leave me today
Your face a rectangled smile
My tangled hair stays down all night
I woke up, watched you sleep for awhile
But some mis-use is alright
Directions send wind along paths
I’d like us to take a long bath
But winds blow you this way and that
And they’re better than i am
So let me take you where the convolvuli lie
Take me where the birds above paris fly
Oh your face a rectangled smile
But you’re nuts to be having a blue period picassoYou might also likeEmbed
