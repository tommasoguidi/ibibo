Little blushing girl 2009 in 2013 LyricsLittle blushing girl
Toilet flushing swirl
I’m just a heartbroken arcade token

Wear my pretty shirt
Fall down in the dirt
I’m just a heartbroken arcade token

Wanted me to fall in love
Don’t know who I’m dreamin’ of
I’m just a heartbroken arcade token
Walkin’ in the park
Laughter in the dark
I’m just a heartbroken arcade tokenYou might also likeEmbed
