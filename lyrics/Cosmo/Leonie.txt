Leonie LyricsEveryone is gone
I turn the light on
He shook me around
Drove on the wrong side of the road

A bakers dozen of bad affairs
But along came Ronnie
I climb up the space between
I'm bitter like olives
That's why you like them and I don't
Rarely
I spend eighty dollars
Red-mouthed hulking
I stand beside Ali
In the mirror hulking
That's why you like me and I don't
Leonie
I'm lonely
Put pipe cleaner gold around me

Leonie
I'm lonely
I'm sitting where we'd sit but now it's different
Meet me at the pier
Cigarettes and beer
I'll cut your hair I don't care
Germany takes you from meYou might also likeEmbed
