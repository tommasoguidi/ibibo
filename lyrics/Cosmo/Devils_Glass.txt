Devil’s Glass LyricsOh, the sentence he said
It got stuck in my head
And I think that I let
It define me for years

Now I’m filled up with lies
And they’re making me cry
When I lie down flat
They fall to one side

Well I'm taking a stance
Against the devil’s glass
Where I don’t look in it
But I want to exist
Oh devil’s glass
Oh waterpark
It’s everything
It’s Vivian
Oh devil’s glass
Oh waterpark
It’s everything
It’s VivianYou might also likeEmbed
