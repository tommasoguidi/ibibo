No sleep 2012 LyricsDo what you want to me, do what you want
I got these black eye and they’re lit from above
And i got red eyes and i’m falling apart
I got dark eyes and i just need love
I screwed up, i’m screwed in
Getting in the way just means getting in my head
And love isn’t love until one of us is dead
An existential crisis is so fucking trite
Fuck these suited loft-bedded boys with their white wine
Smooth hair, good eyes
Sweet-talking icicle, she doesn’t know yet she doesn’t know
Glass, silver, bowtie eyes
Kill me despicable vulgar spy
Meanwhile
Owen doesn’t love me i have a brother who doesn’t love me
A sad-eyed misled bristling puppy
And dad whose afraid of my body
Since fucking when?
Wake me up wiggle my toes
Touch my butt pinch my nose
I don’t want to be in love with you ronnie
It hurts my arms it hurts my bodyYou might also likeEmbed
