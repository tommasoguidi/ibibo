I Do Too LyricsEverybody is nobody
Joey apologizes anyway
When I stay still
I can still feel my body inside of my body
I am nodding inside of my body
I go to the bathroom
'Cause they all got the moves
He tries not to think of you
I do too
I do too
I could be thrilling
If you are willing
To overlook a few things
I am crazy
I have no idea what I'm doing

When he thinks of you
I try not to
I do too
He tries not to think of you
I do too
I do tooYou might also likeEmbed
