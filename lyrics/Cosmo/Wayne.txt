Wayne LyricsI was raised in writing love songs
For someone I hate
Now when I write a real one
It feels like fate

I try to relax my face
In case I make it to old age
But you got me smiling all the time
My eyes go so wide

I was always afraid of starting talking
'Cause I know there's no way of ever stopping
There's no way of fitting everything in
Not everything you say
Has got to let them know something deeper about you
Forgot a bunch of parts of me back then
I want you around while I'm remembering

Like in first grade, how I went by Wayne
I always had another nameYou might also likeEmbed
