Everything with you (blues) LyricsI don’t live on your time
Cause this brain ain’t yours its mine
And I don’t wanna do
What you wanna do
Well every dogs gotta die
But no one knows why
I got the blues
It's all about you
I cry to my boss
Cause I don’t cry a lot
And I got no idea
How to be a grown up
I don’t live on your time
Cause this brain ain’t yours its mine
And I don’t wanna do
