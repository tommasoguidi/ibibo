Twister LyricsJust because I say it, well it
Doesn’t make it so, doesn’t make it so
Make it like a song, erase the
Wondering and woe, wondering and woe

Where are you now? Where are you now?
Where are you now? Where are you now?

Elbow like a pillow but you’ll
Never understand, thought you were my friend
Face it in the stairway, stare it right in the face
Every single day, never get away
You come out as often as the stars do, it's hard to
Follow the blue rain that hits my windows, so do you
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Where are you now? Where are you now?

Feelings are feelings, boo
Follow your twister before it follows youYou might also likeEmbed
