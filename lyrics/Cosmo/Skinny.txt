Skinny LyricsI don't think anorexic is pretty
You tell me you think I’m too skinny

I don't know what to say
I just sulk and turn away
You don't know what you did
I think that is stupid
I think that is stupid!
It’s stupid! That's stupid!
That's stupid that's stupid

I sit in job interview attire
Sweat under thighs, too-hot coffee and spit it out

Now I don't care about being cool
For anyone but you
Now I don't care about being cool
For anyone but you

Are you a mirage? Or are you not?
When I come to and I'm on the floor
You are right there just like before
Just like a movie you pet me smoothly you are so handsomeYou might also likeEmbed
