Light heart LyricsI gotta have a light heart
Gotta have a light
I gotta have a light heart
Gotta have a light

We got the toughest friends
(Doug, Eliza)
Never see them cry

We got the most sensitive lovers
(You, me)
Always on the verge
We got the worst skin
(Pink, red)
Always feelin' dirty

We got the most love
(love, love)
Love love love love love

I gotta have a light heart
Gotta have a lightYou might also likeEmbed
