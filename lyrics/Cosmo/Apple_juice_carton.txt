Apple juice carton Lyrics[spoken]
Just without you? you wanna stay here though? ok

[sung]
I made a couple clay apples
But I didn’t notice they were clay apples
'til I took a bite
I noticed
I took a bite
I noticed
I asked a boy for an
Apple juice carton
And he brought me back more than an
Apple juice carton
And the only picture that I ever
Took of him
Was beside that apple tree
In the garden

But I didn’t know that tree would
I didn’t know that tree would
Never grow
That tree would
Never growYou might also likeEmbed
