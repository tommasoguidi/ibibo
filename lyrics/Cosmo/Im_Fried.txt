I’m Fried LyricsOh you know I’m fried
Oh you know I’m fried

Did you want me to?
Trying to keep it pure
Like it was before
So maybe I won't be yours in fully the same way
But if it’s right then maybe I won’t turn and walk away
I just want to know that I would walk away from wrong
(Oh you know I’m fried)
So maybe I won't be yours in fully the same way
(Oh you know I’m fried)
But if it’s right then maybe I won’t turn and walk away
I just want to know that I would walk away from wrongYou might also likeEmbed
