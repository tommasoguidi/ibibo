Separation Anxiety LyricsI wanna fight dirty, I wanna bite you
I wanna feel flirty, I wanna watch you
Slide in and out of my body
Nothing about me is good how could you love me?
As I passed the church the other day
Church bells chimed at me as if to say:
“O holy one, you’re doing it the right way
You’re doing it the right way”
And I’m fine I was just shocked
L.A. skyline about 2 o’clock
In the morning
You helped me out without a warning
You are on my mind
But I do not mind
Oh holy one
Your love is of the right kind
Your love is of the right kindYou might also likeEmbed
