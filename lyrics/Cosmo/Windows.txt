[Verse 1]
I still like looking out of windows
I know how to forgive those
Sceneries for surrounding me
But you did it differently

[Verse 2]
Don't know how with you
But I'd really like to
Waiting for you to become
Something I heard somewhere once
I want guidance, directions
Even for just a second
[Chorus]
Spit out diamonds, cough up rubies
Call me when you can see through me
Spit out diamonds, cough up rubies
Call me when you can see through me

[Verse 3]
Do I have regrets? Certainly
Mostly the fantasy
I let it it encircle me
But you did it differently

[Verse 4]
Do I bounce? I bounce back
It was really but a worthy task
Slow leak, slow dream
Oh, never noticed you boiling
But to fill it up is quick
You just have to wait for it

[Chorus]
Spit out diamonds, cough up rubies
Call me when you can see through me
Spit out diamonds, cough up rubies
Call me when you can see through me
