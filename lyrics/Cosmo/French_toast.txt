French toast LyricsHe wears a trench coat
I eat French toast
His dreams are boring
I watch him snoring

I am imagining
To be with you dancing
“Your eyes say yes but you
You don’t say yes”

Maybe I’m living
In a spiral
Maybe you are
A broken sparrow
Coloring the view
Of the street
Only I can
See

I look at the earth
Tighten
My hearts got my
Problems frightened
Away
Away

“Your eyes say yes but you
You don’t say yes”You might also likeEmbed
