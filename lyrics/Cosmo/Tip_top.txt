Tip top LyricsFuck UP
Tip top
Sad friends
Long walk
School bus
Dead end
Love
Assurance
I'm looks so sad
I wanna be a friend
But who knows
What anyone wants
When I'm sad
I wanna cry alone
But secretly want
To be hugged and let it out
Weep to Elaiza
Confuse and overwhelm
Talk to Elaiza
Do you have a crush
What's his name
What's he like
Do you think he likes you
Does he like you backYou might also likeEmbed
