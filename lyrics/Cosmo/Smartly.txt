Smartly LyricsWell I can't treat you anything but rough
And anything you do feels good cause I'm in love
And I ain't looking at anybody in grand central
Cause I left my eyes in Pleasantville
And I just wanna take a picture of
Your face when it becomes a rectangle
And I can't treat you anything but rough
And I love you but that's not enough
To keep me sane
I go to museums in winter
And I fold my coat
I try to tell you but something
Gets caught in my throat
I drink my coffee at night
And I sleep on the train
I think I'm losing my mind
When I use my brain
There are so many smart things about me
That doesn't mean I act smartly
