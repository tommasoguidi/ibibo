Order anyway LyricsI've never been stood up before
But it feels sort of like everything
Every day I congratulate myself
On having feelings

Today I thought for a few minutes
That I was really a great person

I think I’ll order anyway
I think I’ll order anyway
Excuse me sir can I please have
A waffle and some scrambled eggs
I find a box of my poems
I’m so sad for what’s mixed in
I’ll tell you later
We're out of Swiffer

My I love you
But I don’t know how to

Imaginary
Real
Don't want you to imagine when I’m right fucking here

I think I’ll order anyway
Excuse me sir can I please have
A waffle and
Some of your best scrambled eggsYou might also likeEmbed
