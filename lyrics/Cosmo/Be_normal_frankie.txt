Be normal frankie LyricsI am all about having a good time
But if you put yourself in danger that's a crime
I just wanna be safe and have a party
I wanna have fun without hurting no one

BE NORMAL FRANKIE BE NORMAL
That's what me said to me
Be normal Frankie, be normal
That's what me said

Friendship is a phase
Everything betrays
I find the warm spot
It's a room not a body part
If you'd've had a dog
Which I don't think you would
You would've looked at me
You would've understood

Be normal Frankie be normal
That's what me said to me
Be normal Frankie be normal
That's what she saidYou might also likeEmbed
