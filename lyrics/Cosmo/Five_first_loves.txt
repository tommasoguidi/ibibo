Five first loves LyricsSometimes i hate watching mom and dad
But boy am i glad to ask you every day if you’re real
Love is not a thing it’s just how i feel
Five first loves
Wearing carhartt gloves
15 dogs on a wall
I wanna kiss em all
5 first loves
Two of em are wearing carhartt gloves
3 of em are holding guitars
2 of em have arm scars
1 of them never loved me back
All of them never loved me back
I don’t know who i hate worse
You or your best friend
Cause i’ve never had 5 first loves like i love aaron
I dreamt i lost my shoes
I dreamt i couldn’t see you
I saw him in my bed
I hurt you in my head
Dreams are a scary place
Dreams are leather with lace
Dreams are a gnarly cunt
Dreams are a fucked up stunt double of real life
Fraternal twin dead wife
A baby in my body
A lady in your body
Five first loves
Wearing carhartt gloves
16 dogs on a wall
I wanna kiss em all
First kiss by the river
Fall in love every winterYou might also likeEmbed
