Rings (On a Tree) LyricsI see now that it was wrong, so wrong
To try to hold on to a fallen tree
One that wouldn't even look at me
Those sticks were all arranged so evenly
Who wasn't holding arms out lovingly

Humiliate your family
Just cause you wanna stand with me
I think your ring means more than our thing

The day after I decided to end it all
I go for a walk and it feels like everything
Is planted to tell me
Not to do it
Oh, how I wish we'd never met
Oh, baby, I was all alone in it
Now I see that I was always me
Underneath everything I ever tried to be
Now I see that there is always you
Turning up in everything I doYou might also likeEmbed
