Prolonging Babyhood LyricsProlonging babyhood
I don't wanna feed myself
Don't wanna think about the future

Put my training wheels back on
And pour the milk in my coffee
Rip the serifs right off my lettering
I don't wanna feel strongly

Don't feel strong enough for unnamed scenarios
How can you love so much?
Mac and cheese, feed me broccoli
I miss you early summer, I hear the cue
Feelings are just feelings before the theory starts

Prolonging babyhood
I don't wanna feed myself
Don't wanna think about the futureYou might also likeEmbed
