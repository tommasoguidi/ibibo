Even Though I Knew LyricsWe never talked about a thing, never went through it
Even though I knew you weren't true to me
The train crawls like our phone calls
I let it go on far too long
I wouldâ€™ve let it go on forever
In the window, my reflection will show

Right after this, I might ask for it
Babe, you know I'd climb under your fence for twenty-five cents
I know it's bad but you know I would
Fifteen dogs on a wall, ten seltzers deep in it all
Check the eggs, that none are cracked
I know you can remember thatYou might also likeEmbed
