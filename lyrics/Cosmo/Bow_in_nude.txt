Bow in nude LyricsWe bow in the nude
You’re forgetfully rude (ah!)

“Can I be yours?” is wrong
I make you mine in a song (ah!)

We sleep heavy, too certain
But I pull up the curtain (ah!)

And it’s revealing
Icy bad feelings (ah!)
’til the river pounds through
Windows crack filled with blue
You’ll think “oh we’re safe”
And leave everything to breakYou might also likeEmbed
