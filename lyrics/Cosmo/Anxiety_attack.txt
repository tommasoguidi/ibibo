Anxiety attack LyricsI feel cold
I feel hot
I can breathe
I cannot
What is up

What is up
In jp?
I feel something wrong with me
Wrong with me
I can't trust anyone
Keys wallet phone
When I have fun
I have my backpack on
My backpack on

I am glad I have Ronnie
A warm soft laundry
You can feel me write your name
You ask what are you writing?
