Church Day LyricsWater to sky, hair to lips
(I) I get it now, after all of this
It never rains like this anymore

Should I put deodorant
On or
My blazer with the condom in the pocket
And I wear my ring

I’m in the pew, you’re in the aisle
As god taps on the mic and says (As god taps on the mic and says)
“Is this thing on?” ("Is this thing on?")
I told that jerk to hold my calls
I love you a lot but (I love you a lot)
(But) everyone else on this planet is a idiot (everyone else on this planet is an idiot)
I love you a lot but everyone else on this planet is a idiotYou might also likeEmbed
