A Soft Dog LyricsA soft dog fuzzes out
Like the river cold spikes up
How a good song brings out in you
What you could never say
But still doesn’t give you the words to

Of course I let the wind
Whip the tears out of me
Or maybe it is just a dream

You’ve been over it
For quite some time
It’s news to me
That you’re not mine
But I don’t care
'Cause deep inside
I always knew
But had to tryYou might also likeEmbed
