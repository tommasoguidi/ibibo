Same Same Same Same LyricsIf you are what you stand up for
It can’t help me understand more
Me me me me me, me me me
Me me me me

‘Cause the trees let the leaves fall
And they don’t move at all
And I’m the same
Lame lame lame lame lame, lame lame lame

I won’t always be able to hear what you say
I’ve gotta leave anyway
Oh god I'll be away
Away away, away away
Sometimes I just wanna be called by name
I wanna know if you met me today
You would love me the same
Same same same, same sameYou might also likeEmbed
