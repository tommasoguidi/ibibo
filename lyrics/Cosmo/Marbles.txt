[Verse 1]
I might go to the party at the house tonight
But maybe I won't
Maybe I won’t
Burn the coffee
One for taste
Gotta watch it go to waste
You wanna be loved (You wanna be loved?)
Do you wanna be seen (Do you wanna be seen?)
You wanna be hated, you wanna be mean
We both know it's all the same
Doesn't matter which way you swing
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wanna extend, sometimes the pain is so immense it’s churning me out
But then you turn around
I'm a lover
I give light
I was never made to fight
Oh darling, I wanna give you all my marbles
You're a perfect planet I want to inhabit
