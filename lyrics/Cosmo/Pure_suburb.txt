Pure suburb LyricsI am a black hole for your love
I just cannot get enough
I suck i suck i suck
And don't give back that much

Pure suburb
Pure suburb

It feels like you didn't pick me back
It just worked out like that
I lack and lack and lack
How could you love me back?
If you wanna feel
Like a failure thats your right
Sings krill at death by audio
Pulls me back to that night
Pure suburb

I watched you and he walked away
Back to some home on the range
And everything had changed
My arm was empty space

You are a black hole for my love
You just cannot get enough
You suck and suck and suck
And dont give back so muchYou might also likeEmbed
