[Testo di "Is This Love?"]

[Strofa 1]
I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter (Alright) of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah!
For Jah provide the bread

[Ritornello 1]
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling? (Is this love that I'm feeling?)
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling? (Alright, yeah)
I want to know, want to know, want to know now (Ah-ah)
Oh yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know now
Got to know, got to know, got to know now
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
[Strofa 2]
I want to love you, I want to love and treat you right
(Love and treat you right)
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, oh now
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room (Oh yeah, alright)
For Jah provide the bread

[Ritornello 2]
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling? (Is this love that I'm feeling?)
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling? (Alright, alright)
Oh yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know now
Oh yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know now
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table

[Outro]
I want to love you (I want to love you)
