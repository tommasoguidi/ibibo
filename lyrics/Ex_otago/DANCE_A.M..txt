[Testo di "DANCE A.M."]

This morning, our nights
And your breath, and your breath, and your breath
Spring time with you
On December in my bedroom
This morning it's all right
And no stress, and no stress, and no stress
Spring time with you
On December in my bedroom
Sometimes on my mind
Friday on my mind
Spring time on my mind today
Sometimes on my mind
Friday on my mind
Spring time on my mind today
Sometimes on my mind
Friday on my mind
Spring time on my mind today
Sometimes on my mind
Friday on my mind
Spring time on my mind today
Sometimes on my mind
Friday on my mind
Spring time on my mind today
