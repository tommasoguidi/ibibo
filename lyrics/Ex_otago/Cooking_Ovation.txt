[Testo di "Cooking Ovation"]

[Intro]
When I'm cooking my telephone call me
I forget to close the doors
When I'm cooking my telephone call me
I forget to close the doors
But there's no doors in my home

[Bridge]
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
There's no doors in my home
[Strofa]
When I'm cooking, my girlfriend does the wash
Kitchen is burning
When I'm cooking, my girlfriend does the wash
Kitchen is burning
When I'm cooking, my girlfriend does the wash
Kitchen is burning
When I'm cooking, my girlfriend does the wash
Kitchen is burning
(Food against the wall)

[Ritornello]
When I'm cooking my telephone call me
I forget to close the doors
When I'm cooking my telephone call me
I forget to close the doors
But there's no doors in my home
(Cooking-cooking-cooking, cooking ovation)
There's no doors in my home
(Cooking-cooking-cooking, cooking ovation)
There's no doors in my home
(Cooking-cooking-cooking, cooking ovation)
There's no doors in my home
