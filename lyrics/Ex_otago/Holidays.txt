[Testo di "Holidays"]

Thank you, holidays, you changed my life
[?] October, [?] spring time
Thank you, holidays, when I was child
[?] my family, holy summer
I can try to bake a cake
In my holidays, in my holidays
I can try to talk with the moon
In my holidays, in my holidays
I see my morning, because I want to live in the holidays
Thank you, holidays, in the summer time
In the middle with my girlfriend
With my mother, with my sister
[?] into the hill and [?]
I can try to bake a cake
In my holidays, in my holidays
I can try to talk with my dog

In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays, in my holidays
In my holidays
