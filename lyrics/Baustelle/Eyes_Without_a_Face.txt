Eyes Without a Face Lyrics[Intro]
I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream
Could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
[Chorus]
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a facе

[Verse 1]
I spend so much time
Beliеving all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

[Chorus]
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
You might also like[Verse 2]
When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh, the gigolo pool
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

[Verse 3]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

[Chorus]
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Les yeus sans visage
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
Such a human waste
Your eyes without a face
[Outro]
And now it's getting worseEmbed
